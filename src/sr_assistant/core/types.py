"""Core types for SR assistant.

Anything used as a SQLModel field type cannot be Literal, SQLAlchemy requires column
types to be classes. So use StrEnum/IntEnum/... instead. Literal is fine nested in
values/schemas.

Notes:
    - Any Enum is `Iterable` by default, Literal types need typing.get_args().
    - ``Literal["a", "b", None]`` is a union, i.e., either "a", "b", or None.
      To allow more than one value use ``list[Literal["a", "b", None]]``.
    - Enums can have JSONSchema (TypeAdapter cls method) and property methods, value
      aliases, etc. But a Pydantic RootModel can be very similar to an enum.
