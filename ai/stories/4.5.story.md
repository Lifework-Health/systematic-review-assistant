# Story 4.5: Create Database Migration for Benchmark Tables

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to create and verify an Alembic migration script so that the new `benchmark_runs` and `benchmark_result_items` tables, along with their foreign key constraints, are correctly added to the database schema.

**Context:** This story is critical for persisting the benchmark data structures defined in US4.3 (`BenchmarkRun`) and US4.4 (`BenchmarkResultItem`). Without this database migration, the application cannot store or retrieve benchmark results. It directly follows the definition of these models.

## Detailed Requirements

- Generate a new Alembic migration script.
- The migration script's `upgrade()` function must create two new tables:
    - `benchmark_runs`: Corresponding to the `BenchmarkRun` SQLModel (defined in US4.3), including all its columns (ID, timestamps, `review_id` FK, `config_details`, `run_notes`, and all individual metric columns like `tp`, `fp`, `sensitivity`, etc.).
    - `benchmark_result_items`: Corresponding to the `BenchmarkResultItem` SQLModel (defined in US4.4), including all its columns (ID, timestamps, `benchmark_run_id` FK, `search_result_id` FK, `human_decision`, AI decision columns, `final_decision`, `classification`).
- Ensure all foreign key constraints are correctly defined in the migration (e.g., `benchmark_runs.review_id` to `systematic_reviews.id`; `benchmark_result_items.benchmark_run_id` to `benchmark_runs.id`; `benchmark_result_items.search_result_id` to `search_results.id`).
- Ensure data types in the migration match the SQLModel definitions (e.g., UUID, TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE, JSONB, TEXT, BOOLEAN, INTEGER, FLOAT).
- The `downgrade()` function in the migration script must correctly drop the `benchmark_result_items` and `benchmark_runs` tables (in the correct order to respect FKs).
- The migration script should be tested by applying it (`alembic upgrade head`) and then reverting it (`alembic downgrade -1`) against the test database (`sra_integration_test`) and the development/prototype database (`postgres` on Supabase).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: An Alembic migration script is generated in the `alembic/versions/` directory.
- AC2: The `upgrade()` function in the migration script successfully creates the `benchmark_runs` and `benchmark_result_items` tables with all specified columns, data types, and foreign key constraints as per the SQLModels defined in US4.3 and US4.4.
- AC3: The `downgrade()` function in the migration script successfully drops the `benchmark_result_items` and `benchmark_runs` tables.
- AC4: Running `uv run alembic upgrade head` (with appropriate `ENVIRONMENT` set for test and then prototype DBs) applies the migration successfully to both the `sra_integration_test` and the Supabase-hosted `postgres` (prototype) databases.
- AC5: Running `uv run alembic downgrade -1` (with appropriate `ENVIRONMENT`) successfully reverts the migration on both databases.
- AC6: After upgrade, database schema inspection (e.g., using a DB tool or `psql \d benchmark_runs`) confirms tables, columns, types, and constraints are correctly created.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](/docs/coding-standards.md) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](/docs/project-structure.md). Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Create: A new migration script in `alembic/versions/` (e.g., `xxxx_add_benchmark_tables.py`).
    - Files to Read From (for reference): `src/sr_assistant/core/models.py` (for `BenchmarkRun` and `BenchmarkResultItem` definitions).
    - Files to Interact With: `alembic.ini`, `alembic/env.py` (implicitly, by running Alembic commands).

- **Key Technologies:**
    - Python 3.12
    - Alembic
    - SQLModel (as models define the schema Alembic will generate from)
    - PostgreSQL (Supabase)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - Not applicable.

- **UI/UX Notes:**
    - Not applicable.

- **Data Structures:**
    - The migration will implement the schemas for `BenchmarkRun` and `BenchmarkResultItem` SQLModels as defined in US4.3 and US4.4.

- **Environment Variables:**
    - `SRA_DATABASE_URL` (for prototype DB) and `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (for integration test DB) as defined in `docs/environment-vars.md` will be used by Alembic via `alembic/env.py` (which should be configured to select the correct URL based on an `ENVIRONMENT` env var like `dev` or `test`).
    - Ensure the `ENVIRONMENT` variable is correctly set when running Alembic commands for different target databases.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Follow Alembic best practices for writing migration scripts.
    - Ensure generated migration scripts are readable and understandable.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Not typically applicable for Alembic migration scripts themselves, but the models they are based on should be sound.
- **Integration Tests (covered by AC4, AC5, AC6):**
    - The primary testing is the successful application and rollback of the migration on the target databases.
    - Schema inspection post-upgrade is a key verification step.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    - Execute `uv run alembic revision -m "add_benchmark_tables"` to generate the script.
    - Manually review the generated script for correctness against the SQLModel definitions.
    - Execute `uv run alembic upgrade head` (setting `ENVIRONMENT=test` then `ENVIRONMENT=prototype` or `dev`) and verify success.
    - Inspect DB schemas.
    - Execute `uv run alembic downgrade -1` (for each environment) and verify success and table removal.
