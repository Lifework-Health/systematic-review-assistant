# Story 2.5: Refactor and Implement ScreeningService for API Alignment and Resolver Logic

**Status:** SUPERSEDED by Stories 2.5A and 2.5B

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I need the `ScreeningService` in `services.py` to be refactored to align with `docs/api-reference.md` (correct method signatures, internal session management, proper Pydantic schema usage) and to implement all new methods required for the conflict resolution workflow, so that screening operations and conflict resolution are robust, maintainable, and correctly implemented.

**Context:** This story addresses a critical architectural violation where the UI layer currently bypasses the service layer and directly calls resolver agents. The architect specified a clean service-layer pattern that must be implemented to ensure proper separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. The current `ScreeningService` has architectural debt that must be resolved.

**Current State Issues Identified by Architect:**
- Large functions with mixed responsibilities (e.g., `add_or_update_screening_result`)
- Direct Pydantic model instantiation issues (using `Model(**data)` instead of `Model.model_validate(data)`)
- Numerous linter errors in service methods
- Missing resolver-related methods entirely

## Detailed Requirements

**Note on Current State of `services.py`:** The existing `src/sr_assistant/app/services.py` file, particularly the `ScreeningService` parts, contains large functions with mixed responsibilities (e.g., `add_or_update_screening_result`), direct Pydantic model instantiation issues (e.g., using `Model(**data)` instead of `Model.model_validate(data)`), and numerous linter errors. The refactoring under this story MUST address these by:
- Breaking down logic into smaller, well-defined private helper methods.
- Adhering to Pydantic best practices for model instantiation (use `.model_validate()`) as per `docs/coding-standards.md`.
- Improving modularity, readability, and testability.
- All linter errors within the refactored `ScreeningService` section MUST be resolved.

### **1. Refactor Existing ScreeningService Methods:**

**Session Management:** All public methods in `ScreeningService` (e.g., `add_screening_decision`, `update_screening_decision`, `get_screening_decision_by_id`, etc.) MUST manage their own database sessions internally. The `session: Session | None` parameter MUST be removed from all public method signatures.

**`add_screening_decision`:**
- Signature MUST be `(self, search_result_id: uuid.UUID, screening_strategy: ScreeningStrategyType, screening_data: schemas.ScreeningResultCreate) -> models.ScreenAbstractResult`.
- Logic MUST correctly create `models.ScreenAbstractResult` from `screening_data` and then update the parent `models.SearchResult` (identified by `search_result_id`) by setting its `conservative_result_id` or `comprehensive_result_id` field based on `screening_strategy`.

**`update_screening_decision`:**
- Signature MUST be `(self, screening_result_id: uuid.UUID, screening_update_data: schemas.ScreeningResultUpdate) -> models.ScreenAbstractResult`.
- Logic MUST fetch the `ScreenAbstractResult` by `screening_result_id` and apply updates from `screening_update_data`.

**Method Consolidation/Removal:** The existing `add_screening_result` and `add_or_update_screening_result` methods in `services.py` should be refactored into or replaced by the correctly defined `add_screening_decision` and `update_screening_decision` methods.

**Linter Error (Instantiation):** Fix the linter error in the current `add_or_update_screening_result` related to `models.ScreenAbstractResult(id=result_id, **update_data)`. Ensure explicit field mapping from the Pydantic input schema (`ScreeningResultCreate`) when instantiating `models.ScreenAbstractResult`.

**Linter Error (Unused Variable):** Address the unused `e` variable in the `except` block of the current `get_screening_result_by_strategy`.

### **2. Implement New Resolver-Related Methods in ScreeningService (as per `docs/api-reference.md`):**

- `identify_disagreements(self, review_id: uuid.UUID, search_result_ids: list[uuid.UUID]) -> list[models.SearchResult]`
- `prepare_resolver_inputs(self, review: models.SystematicReview, search_results_with_disagreements: list[models.SearchResult]) -> list[dict[str, Any]]`
- `invoke_resolver_agent_batch(self, resolver_prompt_variable_inputs: list[dict[str, Any]]) -> list[schemas.ResolverOutputSchema]` (This method calls the LLM chain and does not directly manage DB sessions for the call itself, but subsequent storage does).
- `store_resolution_results(self, review_id: uuid.UUID, search_result_id_to_resolution_data: dict[uuid.UUID, schemas.ResolverOutputSchema]) -> list[models.ScreeningResolution]` (This method handles DB writes and manages its session).
- `resolve_screening_conflicts_for_batch(self, review: models.SystematicReview, search_result_ids_in_batch: list[uuid.UUID]) -> None` (Orchestration method, manages sessions for its sequence of DB operations).

### **3. General Standards:**

- All new and refactored methods must manage sessions internally as appropriate.
- Use defined Pydantic schemas (`ScreeningResultCreate`, `ScreeningResultUpdate`, input dicts and `ResolverOutputSchema` for resolver) for data interchange as per `docs/api-reference.md` and `docs/data-models.md`.
- Implement robust error handling for all operations.
- Resolve all linter errors for `ScreeningService` in `services.py`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: All public methods of `ScreeningService` manage their own DB sessions and no longer accept `session` parameters (where DB interaction occurs).
- AC2: `add_screening_decision` method is implemented with the correct signature and logic, including linking to `SearchResult`.
- AC3: `update_screening_decision` method is implemented with the correct signature and logic.
- AC4: Existing methods `add_screening_result` and `add_or_update_screening_result` are correctly refactored/replaced.
- AC5: Linter errors in existing `ScreeningService` methods (e.g., `**update_data` instantiation, unused `e`) are resolved.
- AC6: All new resolver-related methods (`identify_disagreements`, `prepare_resolver_inputs`, `invoke_resolver_agent_batch`, `store_resolution_results`, `resolve_screening_conflicts_for_batch`) are implemented in `ScreeningService` as per `docs/api-reference.md`.
- AC7: Implemented methods correctly use the Pydantic schemas defined in `docs/data-models.md` and `schemas.py`.
- AC8: All linter errors related to `ScreeningService` in `services.py` are resolved.
- AC9: Unit tests for all `ScreeningService` methods (existing refactored and new) achieve >80% coverage, mocking repositories and LLM calls where appropriate.
- AC10: Relevant integration tests for the resolver workflow involving `ScreeningService` pass.
