# Story 1.4: End-to-End PubMed Search Workflow Stabilization

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform a PubMed search using the `search.py` interface and have the results correctly fetched, stored, and displayed without errors, so that I can reliably gather articles for my systematic review.

**Context:** This story is part of Epic 1 ("Search and Service Layer Stabilization"). It aims to ensure the entire PubMed search workflow is functional and stable, building upon the refactored `search.py` (Story 1.1), `SearchService` (Story 1.2), and `SearchResultRepository` (Story 1.3). Successful completion of this story means the core PubMed search functionality is reliable from UI to database.

## Detailed Requirements

(Copied from `docs/epics/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md#Story-1.4`)

- The entire flow from entering a search query in `search.py`, triggering `SearchService`, fetching from PubMed, transforming to `SearchResult` objects, storing via `SearchResultRepository`, and displaying in `search.py` must be functional.
- All linter errors in `search.py`, `services.py` (related to search), and `repositories.py` (related to `SearchResultRepository`) that impact this workflow must be resolved.
- The system should prevent duplicate storage of the same PubMed article for the same review.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

(Copied from `docs/epics/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md#Story-1.4`)

- AC1: User can successfully execute a PubMed search from the `search.py` UI.
- AC2: Search results are displayed correctly in the UI using `SearchResult` data (specifically `schemas.SearchResultRead`).
- AC3: `SearchResult` instances are correctly persisted in the database via the service and repository layers.
- AC4: No Python errors or exceptions occur during the PubMed search and result display workflow.
- AC5: Attempting to store the same PubMed article for the same review multiple times does not create duplicate entries (verified via `exists_by_source_id` or similar logic in service).
- AC6: Error handling for the PubMed search is robust.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

    - Files to Modify/Verify:
        - `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/search.py`
        - `src/sr_assistant/app/services.py` (specifically `SearchService`)
        - `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py` (specifically `SearchResultRepository`)
        - `src/sr_assistant/core/models.py` (ensure `SearchResult` model is stable)
        - `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` (ensure `SearchResultRead` is stable)

- **Key Technologies:**

    - Streamlit (for UI)
    - Python, Pydantic, SQLModel, SQLAlchemy
    - BioPython (or equivalent for PubMed API interaction, encapsulated in `SearchService`)

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    - Primarily internal:
        - `search.py` calls `SearchService.search_pubmed_and_store_results`.
        - `SearchService` calls `SearchResultRepository` methods (e.g., `add_all`, `exists_by_source_id`).
        - `SearchService` interacts with PubMed API.

- **UI/UX Notes:**

    - Focus is on workflow stability. UI should be functional as refactored in Story 1.1.

- **Data Structures:**

    - `schemas.SearchResultRead` (for UI display and service return type)
    - `models.SearchResult` (for database persistence)

- **Environment Variables:**

    - `NCBI_API_KEY` and `NCBI_EMAIL` (used by `SearchService`). Ensure these are set in `.env` or `.env.local` for local testing.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

    - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    - Ensure duplicate prevention logic in `SearchService` (likely within `search_pubmed_and_store_results` or a helper) is robust. This typically involves checking if a result with the same `source_id` (e.g., PMID) and `review_id` already exists before adding. The `exists_by_source_id` method in `SearchResultRepository` (if implemented as per Story 1.3 definition in the epic) should be utilized.

- **Project Structure Alignment:**
    - Verification and potential minor fixes may span across `pages`, `services`, and `core` directories as listed in "Relevant Files".

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md` and specific UI testing practices from `docs/streamlit-testing-framework.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Existing unit tests for `search.py`, `SearchService`, and `SearchResultRepository` (from Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) should cover most component-level logic.
    - If specific logic for duplicate prevention in `SearchService` is complex, ensure it has dedicated unit tests (mocking repository calls).
- **Integration Tests:**
    - An integration test for `SearchService.search_pubmed_and_store_results` in `tests/integration/app/test_services.py` should exist (from Story 1.2) that:
        - Mocks the PubMed API call to return a fixed set of known articles.
        - Verifies that articles are correctly mapped, stored in the test database, and duplicates are handled (i.e., not re-stored if called again with same data for the same review).
        - Verifies that `schemas.SearchResultRead` objects are returned.
- **Streamlit UI Tests (using `AppTest` from `docs/streamlit-testing-framework.md`):**
    - Create a new test file (e.g., `tests/integration/app/pages/test_search_workflow.py`).
    - **Test Case 1: Successful PubMed Search and Display (AC1, AC2, AC4):**
        - Initialize `AppTest` for `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/search.py`.
        - Simulate selection of an existing systematic review (e.g., by setting `st.session_state.current_review_id` if applicable, or interacting with a review selection widget if present on the search page).
        - Simulate entering a search query (e.g., `at.text_input(key="pubmed_query_input").input("test query").run()`).
        - Simulate clicking the search button (e.g., `at.button(key="pubmed_search_button").click().run()`).
        - Assert that no Python exceptions occurred (`assert not at.exception`).
        - Assert that search results are displayed correctly (e.g., check `len(at.dataframe)` or other elements used to display results, and verify content if possible by inspecting `at.dataframe.value` or `at.markdown.value`).
        - This test covers AC1, AC2, and parts of AC4.
    - **Test Case 2: Data Persistence (AC3 - requires DB check, can be combined or follow-up):**
        - This is harder to verify directly with `AppTest` alone as it primarily tests UI and script execution.
        - After a successful search simulation (as in Test Case 1), if the UI provides feedback of successful storage (e.g., a success message), assert that.
        - Actual database verification for AC3 might still rely on integration tests of the `SearchService` or a manual check for initial story validation if `AppTest` cannot trigger a UI element that reads back the persisted count or specific data. Alternatively, if the search page UI re-queries and displays persisted data, subsequent interactions in `AppTest` could verify this.
    - **Test Case 3: Duplicate Prevention (AC5 - requires DB check or UI feedback):**
        - Perform a successful search simulation as in Test Case 1.
        - Record the number of results displayed or a unique identifier from a displayed result.
        - Simulate performing the exact same search query again for the same review.
        - Assert that the UI still displays the results correctly and that the number of unique results has not increased unexpectedly (or check for UI feedback indicating no new duplicates were added).
        - Similar to AC3, direct DB verification of no duplicates might be better covered by service-level integration tests. `AppTest` can verify the UI's behavior when duplicates are expected to be handled.
    - **Test Case 4: Error Handling by SearchService (AC4):**
        - Mock `SearchService.search_pubmed_and_store_results` to raise an exception.
        - Initialize `AppTest` for `search.py`.
        - Simulate search action.
        - Assert that `search.py` displays an appropriate error message (e.g., `assert at.error.value == "Search failed..."`).

## Reviewer Comments (Technical Scrum Master/Engineering Lead)

**Review Date:** 2025-05-17
**Reviewer:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (Technical Scrum Master/Engineering Lead)
**Status:** Done

**Overall Assessment:** Approved. The implementation of Story 1.4 successfully stabilizes the end-to-end PubMed search workflow.

**Key Verifications & Code Review Details:**

- **Duplicate Prevention (AC5):**

    - The `SearchResultRepository.get_existing_source_ids` method in `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py` is correctly implemented and used.
    - `SearchService.search_pubmed_and_store_results` in `src/sr_assistant/app/services.py` was refactored to proactively use `get_existing_source_ids` to filter out already existing PMIDs before fetching full article details and attempting to store them. This significantly improves efficiency and correctness of duplicate handling.
    - The integration test `test_search_pubmed_and_store_results` in `tests/integration/app/test_services.py` accurately verifies this proactive duplicate handling by asserting that the service returns an empty list on a subsequent identical search and that the database count remains unchanged.
    - The UI integration test `test_duplicate_search_ui_behavior` in `tests/integration/app/pages/test_search_workflow.py` also confirms that the database count of unique articles does not increase after a duplicate search initiated from the UI.

- **UI Testing (`AppTest`) (AC1, AC2, AC4, part of AC6):**

    - The `AppTest`-based UI tests, correctly located in `tests/integration/app/pages/test_search_workflow.py`, are well-structured and cover:
        - Successful search and display, including verification of data persistence in the test database (`test_successful_search_and_display`).
        - UI behavior and database integrity during duplicate searches (`test_duplicate_search_ui_behavior`).
        - UI error message display when the backend service simulates a failure (`test_ui_error_handling_on_search_failure`).
    - These tests appropriately mock external PubMed API calls using `mocker.patch("sr_assistant.app.services.Entrez")` and run against a real test database, justifying their classification as integration tests.

- **Error Handling & Robustness (AC4, AC6):**

    - `SearchService` includes checks for NCBI credentials.
    - UI tests confirm that `search.py` displays errors propagated from the service layer.
    - The proactive duplicate handling also contributes to robustness by preventing unnecessary database write attempts for known duplicates.

- **Code Quality & Standards:**

    - The use of `session.exec(select())` is consistent in repositories.
    - Necessary `type: ignore[attr-defined]` comments for SQLAlchemy's dynamic attributes (`in_`, `ilike`) are acceptable.
    - A minor, persistent linter warning in `src/sr_assistant/app/services.py` (around line 982, related to an unused exception variable `e` in `ScreeningService.get_screening_result_by_strategy`) was noted but is considered non-critical as the primary logic is sound.

- **Task Completion & File Cleanup:** All developer-completed tasks ([x]) align with the accomplished work and the successful verification of ACs. The misplaced UI test file in `tests/unit/app/pages/` was correctly identified and deleted, ensuring tests are in their proper integration directory.

**Conclusion:**
The story goals have been met. The PubMed search workflow is now demonstrably more robust, with effective duplicate prevention and comprehensive automated testing covering service logic and UI interactions. The developer agent successfully addressed the core requirements, and the test structure has been rationalized.
