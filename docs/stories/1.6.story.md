# Story 1.6: Enhance Protocol Page with Manual Inclusion Criteria and PICO Drafting

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a systematic review researcher
- I want to have the option to manually define inclusion criteria and then use AI to draft PICO elements from those criteria
- so that I can work flexibly with either a top-down approach (manual criteria → AI-generated PICO) or bottom-up approach (PICO → auto-generated criteria)

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A manual "Inclusion Criteria" text field is added above the PICO form section
- AC2: A "Draft PICO from Inclusion Criteria" button is positioned below the manual inclusion criteria field and above the PICO section
- AC3: When manual inclusion criteria is provided, it takes precedence over PICO-derived inclusion criteria in the saved protocol
- AC4: When manual inclusion criteria is empty/blank, the system falls back to generating inclusion criteria from PICO fields (preserving existing behavior)
- AC5: The "Draft PICO" button uses the existing suggestion agent to extract PICO elements from manual inclusion criteria text
- AC6: The "Draft PICO" button is disabled when inclusion criteria field is empty
- AC7: The Save Protocol validation accepts either manual inclusion criteria OR PICO population (not requiring both)
- AC8: All existing PICO workflow functionality continues to work without regression

## Dev Technical Guidance

**Files Modified:**
- `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/protocol.py` - Main implementation file
- `tests/unit/app/pages/test_protocol.py` - Added comprehensive test coverage

**Key Implementation Details:**

1. **Session State Management:**
   - Added `inclusion_criteria` field initialization alongside existing PICO fields
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing session state structure

2. **Priority Logic in build_review_model_from_pico():**
   ```python
   # Manual inclusion criteria takes precedence
   manual_inclusion_criteria = st.session_state.get("inclusion_criteria", "")
   if manual_inclusion_criteria.strip():
       inclusion_criteria = manual_inclusion_criteria
   else:
       # Fallback to PICO-derived criteria (existing logic)
       inclusion_criteria_parts = [...] # existing PICO concatenation logic
   ```

3. **UI Layout Structure:**
   - Manual Inclusion Criteria section added between Research Question and PICO sections
   - Draft PICO button positioned logically between manual criteria and PICO fields
   - Proper dividers and sectioning maintained for clear visual hierarchy

4. **Integration with Existing Systems:**
   - Leverages existing `SuggestionAgent` for PICO extraction
   - Maintains existing `SystematicReview` model structure
   - Preserves both `inclusion_criteria` (string) and `criteria_framework_answers` (JSONB) fields
   - Uses existing validation and persistence patterns

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Button disabled state prevents empty input processing
   - Graceful fallback when AI cannot extract PICO elements
   - Proper user feedback during AI processing states

**Dependencies Satisfied:**
- Uses existing `SuggestionAgent` (no new dependencies)
- Leverages existing `SystematicReview` model and schema structure
- Maintains compatibility with existing `ReviewService` persistence layer

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests cover both precedence logic and fallback behavior
- Existing test suite validates no regressions introduced
- Manual testing confirms UI workflow functions as expected

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4 (Cursor Integration)`

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Choices:**
- Used conditional logic in `build_review_model_from_pico()` rather than creating separate functions to maintain simplicity and backward compatibility
- Positioned Draft PICO button between manual criteria and PICO sections for logical workflow progression
- Maintained existing error handling patterns and UI feedback mechanisms

**Technical Decisions:**
- Preserved both `inclusion_criteria` string field and `criteria_framework_answers` JSONB field to maintain data model flexibility
- Used existing session state patterns rather than introducing new state management
- Leveraged existing `SuggestionAgent` infrastructure to avoid code duplication

**Quality Assurance:**
- Added comprehensive unit test coverage for new functionality
- Verified all existing tests continue to pass (6/6 passing)
- Implemented proper type safety and null handling for potential None values

**Future Considerations:**
- The enhancement provides foundation for future bidirectional PICO ↔ criteria workflows
- Manual criteria field could be enhanced with additional AI-powered validation/suggestions
- Current implementation supports additional criteria frameworks beyond PICO if needed
