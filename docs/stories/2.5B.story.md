# Story 2.5B: Implement ScreeningService Resolver Methods

**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Priority:** HIGH - Core resolver functionality

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I need all resolver-related methods implemented in `ScreeningService` with proper transaction boundaries, error handling, and batch processing capabilities, so that the conflict resolution workflow is robust and maintainable.

**Context:** This story implements the NEW resolver methods in `ScreeningService` after the core refactoring (Story 2.5A) is complete. This provides the service layer that `screen_abstracts.py` will call.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: `identify_disagreements` method correctly identifies INCLUDE vs EXCLUDE conflicts only
- AC2: `prepare_resolver_inputs` method formats data for resolver agent consumption  
- AC3: `invoke_resolver_agent_batch` method handles LLM batch calls with proper error handling
- AC4: `store_resolution_results` method persists data with proper transaction boundaries
- AC5: `resolve_screening_conflicts_for_batch` orchestrator method coordinates the full workflow
- AC6: Batch processing handles realistic limits (e.g., 50+ conflicts) appropriately
- AC7: Partial batch failures are handled gracefully with rollback mechanisms
- AC8: All methods have >80% unit test coverage with mocked dependencies

## Technical Specifications

### **Method Signatures:**

```python
def identify_disagreements(
    self, 
    review_id: uuid.UUID, 
    search_result_ids: list[uuid.UUID]
) -> list[models.SearchResult]:
    """Identify SearchResults with INCLUDE vs EXCLUDE disagreements only."""
    
def prepare_resolver_inputs(
    self, 
    review: models.SystematicReview, 
    search_results_with_disagreements: list[models.SearchResult]
) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Prepare input data for resolver agent batch processing."""
    
def invoke_resolver_agent_batch(
    self, 
    resolver_prompt_variable_inputs: list[dict[str, Any]]
) -> list[schemas.ResolverOutputSchema]:
    """Call resolver LLM chain for batch processing."""
    
def store_resolution_results(
    self, 
    review_id: uuid.UUID, 
    search_result_id_to_resolution_data: dict[uuid.UUID, schemas.ResolverOutputSchema]
) -> list[models.ScreeningResolution]:
    """Store resolution results with proper transaction boundaries."""
    
def resolve_screening_conflicts_for_batch(
    self, 
    review: models.SystematicReview, 
    search_result_ids_in_batch: list[uuid.UUID]
) -> None:
    """Orchestrate the full conflict resolution workflow."""
```

### **Key Implementation Patterns:**

1. **Disagreement Identification Logic:**
   ```python
   # Only INCLUDE vs EXCLUDE conflicts, per Epic 2 FR1
   conservative_decision = search_result.conservative_result.decision  
   comprehensive_decision = search_result.comprehensive_result.decision
   
   is_disagreement = (
       (conservative_decision == ScreeningDecisionType.INCLUDE and 
        comprehensive_decision == ScreeningDecisionType.EXCLUDE) or
       (conservative_decision == ScreeningDecisionType.EXCLUDE and 
        comprehensive_decision == ScreeningDecisionType.INCLUDE)
   )
   # UNCERTAIN decisions do NOT trigger resolver per Epic 2 FR1
   ```

2. **Transaction Boundary Pattern:**
   ```python
   def store_resolution_results(self, ...):
       with self.session_factory() as session:
           try:
               # 1. Create ScreeningResolution records
               resolutions = []
               for search_result_id, resolution_data in mapping.items():
                   resolution = models.ScreeningResolution(...)
                   resolutions.append(self.resolution_repo.add(session, resolution))
               
               # 2. Update SearchResult.final_decision and resolution_id  
               for resolution in resolutions:
                   search_result = self.search_repo.get_by_id(session, resolution.search_result_id)
                   search_result.final_decision = resolution.resolver_decision
                   search_result.resolution_id = resolution.id
                   self.search_repo.update(session, search_result)
               
               session.commit()
               return resolutions
           except Exception as e:
               session.rollback()
               raise ServiceError(f"Failed to store resolution results: {e}") from e
   ```

3. **Batch Processing with Limits:**
   ```python
   def invoke_resolver_agent_batch(self, inputs):
       # Handle batch size limits (e.g., max 50 per batch)
       BATCH_SIZE_LIMIT = 50
       results = []
       
       for i in range(0, len(inputs), BATCH_SIZE_LIMIT):
           batch_slice = inputs[i:i + BATCH_SIZE_LIMIT] 
           batch_results = # ... call resolver agent batch
           results.extend(batch_results)
           
       return results
   ```
