# Story 1.3: Implement Specific Methods for `SearchResultRepository`, Define `SearchResultFilter` for Queries, and Verify Inherited CRUD

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want `SearchResultRepository` in `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py` to correctly inherit and utilize CRUD operations from `BaseRepository[SearchResult]`, to implement additional specific query methods using a newly defined `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema for defining query parameters, and for all interactions to correctly recognize `SearchResult` as a SQLModel, so that data persistence and retrieval for `SearchResult` entities are reliable, efficient, and align with architectural patterns and established conventions.

**Context:** This story is a core part of Epic 1 ("Search and Service Layer Stabilization"). It ensures that the `SearchResultRepository` is robust. It leverages the generic `BaseRepository` for standard CRUD operations and extends it with `SearchResult`-specific query capabilities. This story now also includes the definition of `SearchResultFilter`, a Pydantic schema essential for advanced search and count functionalities. Reliable data persistence for search results is critical.

## Detailed Requirements

1.  **Ensure `SearchResultRepository` in `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py` exists and correctly inherits from `BaseRepository[SearchResult]`.**
    *   Verify that `BaseRepository` and its generic instantiation for `SearchResult` (which is a SQLModel) are functional. Flag any issues with `BaseRepository` as critical dependencies.

2.  **Define `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema in `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` for Querying.**
    *   This Pydantic schema will be used to define filter parameters for `advanced_search` and `count` methods.
    *   Fields should correspond to attributes of the `SearchResult` SQLModel and be optional to allow flexible querying (e.g., `title: str | None = None`, `year: str | None = None`, `source_db: SearchDatabaseSource | None = None`, etc.).
    *   It should inherit from `schemas.BaseSchema` or an equivalent base Pydantic schema.

3.  **Verify Usage of Inherited CRUD Methods from `BaseRepository`:**
    *   The repository will inherit `get_by_id`, `get_all`, `list`, `add`, `add_all`, `update`, and `delete`.
    *   The `SearchService` will be responsible for:
        *   For `create` operations: Constructing a `SearchResult` SQLModel instance (from a `SearchResultCreate` Pydantic schema or dictionary) and passing it to the inherited `add(session, record: SearchResult)` method.
        *   For `update` operations: Fetching an existing `SearchResult` SQLModel instance, applying updates (from a `SearchResultUpdate` Pydantic schema or dictionary) to this instance, and then passing the modified `SearchResult` SQLModel instance to the inherited `update(session, record: SearchResult)` method.
    *   No re-implementation of these standard CRUD methods is needed in `SearchResultRepository` itself.

4.  **Implement `get_by_doi(self, db: Session, *, doi: str) -> SearchResult | None`:**
    *   Retrieves a `SearchResult` SQLModel by its DOI.
    *   Returns `None` if not found.
    *   Handles potential database errors gracefully, raising `RepositoryError` or its subclasses.

5.  **Implement `get_by_title_and_year(self, db: Session, *, title: str, year: str) -> SearchResult | None`:**
    *   Retrieves a `SearchResult` SQLModel by its title and publication year.
    *   Returns `None` if not found.
    *   Handles potential database errors gracefully.

6.  **Implement `advanced_search(self, db: Session, *, search_params: SearchResultFilter, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100) -> list[SearchResult]`:**
    *   Retrieves a list of `SearchResult` SQLModel entities based on complex criteria defined in the `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema.
    *   Includes pagination (`skip`, `limit`).
    *   Handles potential database errors gracefully.

7.  **Implement `count(self, db: Session, *, search_params: SearchResultFilter | None = None) -> int`:**
    *   Counts `SearchResult` SQLModel entities, optionally filtered by `search_params` (using the `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema).
    *   Handles potential database errors gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: `SearchResultRepository` is correctly defined and inherits from `BaseRepository[SearchResult]` (where `SearchResult` is a SQLModel).
- AC2: The `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema is defined in `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` with appropriate optional fields for querying `SearchResult` attributes.
- AC3: Inherited CRUD methods (`get_by_id`, `add`, `update`, `delete`, `list`, `get_all`, `add_all`) from `BaseRepository` are usable for `SearchResult` SQLModel entities, with the service layer correctly preparing SQLModel instances for `add` and `update`.
- AC4: The `get_by_doi` method is implemented in `SearchResultRepository`, functional, and returns a `SearchResult` SQLModel or `None`.
- AC5: The `get_by_title_and_year` method is implemented in `SearchResultRepository`, functional, and returns a `SearchResult` SQLModel or `None`.
- AC6: The `advanced_search` method is implemented in `SearchResultRepository`, uses the `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema for parameters, is functional, and returns a list of `SearchResult` SQLModel objects, supporting pagination.
- AC7: The `count` method is implemented in `SearchResultRepository`, uses the `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema for parameters, is functional, and returns an integer count.
- AC8: All newly implemented methods in `SearchResultRepository` include appropriate error handling for database operations (raising `RepositoryError` or subclasses).
- AC9: `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py` and `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` (for `SearchResultFilter`) are free of linter errors related to the implemented/defined code for this story. (Note: Existing linter errors in `BaseRepository` are out of scope for this specific story unless they block `SearchResultRepository` functionality).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create/Modify: `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` (for `SearchResultFilter`)
  - Files to Modify: `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py` (for `SearchResultRepository` methods)

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Python, SQLModel, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic

- **Dependencies:**
  - `SearchResult` (SQLModel, defined in `src/sr_assistant/core/models.py`).
  - `BaseRepository` (from `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py`). Its stability and correct generic functioning for `BaseRepository[ModelType: SQLModel]` are crucial.
  - Service layer (e.g., `SearchService`) will be responsible for using Pydantic schemas (`SearchResultCreate`, `SearchResultUpdate` from Story 1.5) and providing `SearchResult` SQLModel instances or dictionaries as appropriate to the repository methods.

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - N/A (Direct database interaction via SQLModel/SQLAlchemy ORM)

- **UI/UX Notes:**
  - N/A

- **Data Structures:**
  - `SearchResult` (SQLModel, defined in `src/sr_assistant/core/models.py`)
  - `SearchResultFilter` (Pydantic Schema, to be defined in `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py`)

- **Environment Variables:**
  - N/A

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Follow general Python, SQLModel, and Pydantic best practices.
  - Ensure repository methods are session-scoped (i.e., accept `db: Session` as an argument).
  - Inherited `add` and `update` methods from `BaseRepository` expect full SQLModel instances (`record: SearchResult`). The service layer prepares these.
  - Newly implemented query methods should be efficient.
  - Refer to `docs/coding-standards.md` for project-specific guidelines.

- **Project Structure Alignment:**
  - New methods for `SearchResultRepository` should be within its class definition in `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py`.
  - The `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema should be defined in `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create/update unit tests in `tests/unit/core/test_repositories.py` and `tests/unit/core/test_schemas.py` (or similar appropriate locations).
  - Test that `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema is suitable for query parameters (e.g., fields are optional, correct types).
  - For each **newly implemented** method in `SearchResultRepository` (`get_by_doi`, `get_by_title_and_year`, `advanced_search`, `count`):
    - Test successful case (e.g., finding an entity, correct count, correct filtering with the `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema).
    - Test not found cases where applicable.
    - Test edge cases or error conditions.
    - For `advanced_search` and `count`, test with various filter parameters (via the `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema) and pagination.
  - Mock database sessions and calls appropriately.
  - Verification of inherited CRUD methods primarily occurs at the integration test level via the service, but basic sanity checks for `SearchResultRepository` instantiation can be included.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - `SearchService` (Story 1.2) integration tests will cover the usage of both inherited and new `SearchResultRepository` methods, including those using the `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema for query parameters.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - N/A

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)
- **Completion Notes:**
All specified methods (`get_by_doi`, `get_by_title_and_year`, `advanced_search`, `count`) for `SearchResultRepository` have been implemented in `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py`. The `SearchResultFilter` Pydantic schema has been defined in `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py`.

Unit tests for all newly implemented repository methods and the `SearchResultFilter` schema have been added to `tests/unit/core/test_repositories.py` and `tests/unit/core/test_schemas.py` respectively. All tests (133) are passing.

The previous blocker related to `SystematicReview` instantiations missing `inclusion_criteria` in `tests/unit/core/test_repositories.py` was resolved. Other suspected issues from the previous completion notes were investigated and found to be either already addressed or not currently problematic. Fixture issues for the new tests were identified and resolved. Assertions in tests for `advanced_search` and `count` were updated to correctly handle SQL parameter binding.

Linters (`ruff check --fix`) and formatters (`ruff format`) have been run on the modified files. One `TODO` comment remains in `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` as per user instruction to ignore it for now. No other linter errors were reported for the modified code.

The story can be considered complete from an implementation and unit testing perspective for the defined scope.
