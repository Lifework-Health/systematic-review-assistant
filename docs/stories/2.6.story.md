# Story 2.6: Refactor Screening Workflow for Service Layer Integration & UI Error Resolution

**Status:** In-Progress

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I need the abstract screening process to be managed by the `ScreeningService`, which will correctly invoke the screening agent and handle data persistence, and the `screen_abstracts.py` UI page to be updated to use this service. This will ensure robust data handling, adherence to architecture, and resolution of the current `ValidationError` on the screening page.

**Context:**
This story focuses on architecturally aligning the abstract screening workflow. The core screening agent (`screen_abstracts_chain` and `screen_abstracts_batch` in `src/sr_assistant/app/agents/screening_agents.py`) is now considered functional (returning `ScreeningResult` instances correctly after LangChain/Pydantic versions were pinned to resolve a prior regression).

The current issue (as of latest testing) is a `ValidationError` on the `screen_abstracts.py` page: `1 validation error for SearchResultRead conservative_result_id Object has no attribute 'conservative_result_id'`. This occurs because the UI page attempts to use `schemas.SearchResultRead` instances (populated in `st.session_state.search_results` by the search page) directly with the `screen_abstracts_batch` agent function, which expects to modify mutable `models.SearchResult` instances (e.g., to set `conservative_result_id`).

This story will resolve this by ensuring the `ScreeningService` orchestrates the screening: it will fetch fresh `models.SearchResult` instances, invoke the screening agent with these models, and persist results. The `screen_abstracts.py` page will be refactored to call this service, adhering to the UI -> Service -> Repository pattern and fixing the `ValidationError`.

## Detailed Requirements

1. **`ScreeningService` - New Method for Batch Screening Orchestration:**

   - Implement a new method in `ScreeningService` (e.g., `perform_batch_abstract_screening(review_id: UUID, search_result_ids_to_screen: list[UUID]) -> list[ScreenAbstractResultTuple]`).
   - This service method will:
   - Fetch the `models.SystematicReview` instance using `ReviewService` or `SystematicReviewRepository`.
   - Fetch the required `list[models.SearchResult]` (SQLModel instances) from the database using `SearchResultRepository` based on `search_result_ids_to_screen`.
   - Invoke `screen_abstracts_batch` (from `screening_agents.py`) with the fetched `models.SearchResult` list and the review. `screen_abstracts_batch` is assumed to be correctly returning `ScreenAbstractResultTuple` containing `ScreeningResult` or `ScreeningError` and modified `models.SearchResult`.
   - For each successful screening tuple returned by the agent:
   - Persist the `ScreeningResult` data (conservative and comprehensive strategies) by creating `models.ScreenAbstractResult` records. This involves using `ScreenAbstractResultRepository` and potentially a `schemas.ScreeningResultCreate` DTO.
   - Update the original `models.SearchResult` instance in the database (via `SearchResultRepository.update()`) with its newly acquired `conservative_result_id` and `comprehensive_result_id`.
   - Handle and log any `ScreeningError` instances returned by the agent.
   - Return appropriate data to the UI (e.g., the list of `ScreenAbstractResultTuple` or a summary of outcomes).
   - This service method must manage its own database session and transactions.

2. **Refactor `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/screen_abstracts.py` UI Page:**

   - Modify the page to call the new `ScreeningService.perform_batch_abstract_screening()` method.
   - The list of items to screen should be passed to the service, likely as a list of `search_result_id`s derived from `st.session_state.search_results`.
   - Remove direct calls to `screen_abstracts_batch` and direct repository calls for loading `SearchResult` instances _for the purpose of passing them to the screening agent_.
   - The page should use the data returned by the `ScreeningService` to update its display and `st.session_state` (e.g., `st.session_state.screen_abstracts_results`, `screen_abstracts_conflicts`, metrics).
   - This refactoring will resolve the `ValidationError` by ensuring that attribute modifications like `conservative_result_id` are performed on `models.SearchResult` instances fetched and managed within the service layer, not on `schemas.SearchResultRead` instances from the UI's session state.

3. **Refine Screening Agent API (If Necessary):**
   - Review the API of `screen_abstracts_batch` and `make_screen_abstracts_chain_input`. If the `ScreeningService` integration reveals further needs for simplification (e.g., how `RunnableConfig` is handled, or if the agent should return data in a more service-friendly format), make those refinements within `screening_agents.py`. The goal is a clean interface for the service.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A new method in `ScreeningService` successfully orchestrates the batch abstract screening: it fetches `models.SearchResult` instances, calls `screen_abstracts_batch` with these mutable models, and correctly persists all screening decisions (`models.ScreenAbstractResult`) and updates to `models.SearchResult` (linkage IDs like `conservative_result_id`).
- AC2: `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/screen_abstracts.py` is refactored to use the new `ScreeningService` method for initiating and processing abstract screening.
- AC3: The `ValidationError: 1 validation error for SearchResultRead conservative_result_id Object has no attribute 'conservative_result_id'` on the screening page is resolved.
- AC4: The screening agent (`screen_abstracts_batch`) correctly receives `models.SearchResult` instances and can modify them as intended.
- AC5: Unit tests for the new `ScreeningService` method(s) cover its full logic (data fetching, agent invocation, data persistence) using mocks.
- AC6: Unit tests for `screen_abstracts.py` are updated to verify its correct interaction with the (mocked) `ScreeningService`.
- AC7: Unit tests for `screening_agents.py` confirm `screen_abstracts_batch` processes `models.SearchResult` correctly.
- AC8: **Integration tests for the `ScreeningService.perform_batch_abstract_screening` method verify the end-to-end flow of data fetching, agent invocation (with mocked LLM calls within the agent if necessary, or using the live agent for a full integration test), and correct database persistence of screening results and `SearchResult` updates. These tests should interact with a real test database.**
- AC9: **`AppTest`-based UI integration tests for `screen_abstracts.py` (similar in structure to `tests/integration/app/pages/test_search_workflow.py`) verify that initiating screening via the UI correctly calls the `ScreeningService`, handles its response, and updates the UI display appropriately. These tests will mock the `ScreeningService` to control its output and verify UI reactions.**
- AC10: All linter errors in modified files are resolved.
- AC11: All mocking in unit and integration tests MUST use `pytest-mock` and its `mocker` fixture, not `unittest.mock`.

## Technical Implementation Context

- **Primary Files for Modification:**
  - `src/sr_assistant/app/services.py` (Implement new `ScreeningService` method)
  - `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/screen_abstracts.py` (Refactor to use `ScreeningService`)
  - `src/sr_assistant/app/agents/screening_agents.py` (Potential API refinements for `screen_abstracts_batch`)
- **Supporting Files (Verify/Ensure Methods Exist):**
  - `src/sr_assistant/core/repositories.py` (`SearchResultRepository`, `ScreenAbstractResultRepository`)
  - `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` (e.g., `ScreeningResultCreate` for service layer use)
- **Reference for Working Agent Logic (Post-LangChain Pinning):** The current `src/sr_assistant/app/agents/screening_agents.py` is assumed to be functional in terms of its LLM calls and `ScreeningResult` production from its callback, due to version pinning.
- **Test File Locations:**
  - Unit tests for agents: `tests/unit/app/agents/test_screening_agents.py`
  - Unit tests for services: `tests/unit/app/test_services.py` (add new tests for `ScreeningService`)
  - Unit tests for UI pages: `tests/unit/app/pages/test_screen_abstracts.py` (or similar, for `screen_abstracts.py` logic mocking the service)
  - Integration tests for services: `tests/integration/app/test_services.py` (add new tests for `ScreeningService` E2E flow)
  - Integration tests for UI pages (AppTest): `tests/integration/app/pages/test_screen_abstracts_workflow.py` (new file, similar to `test_search_workflow.py`)

## Tasks / Subtasks

1. **Design `ScreeningService.perform_batch_abstract_screening` Method:**
   - Define precise input (e.g., `review_id`, `list_of_search_result_ids`) and output (e.g., `list[ScreenAbstractResultTuple]`).
2. **Implement `ScreeningService.perform_batch_abstract_screening`:**
   - Fetch `models.SystematicReview`.
   - Fetch `list[models.SearchResult]` based on input IDs.
   - Call `screen_abstracts_batch` from `screening_agents.py`.
   - Loop through results from `screen_abstracts_batch`:
   - Create `schemas.ScreeningResultCreate` DTOs for conservative and comprehensive results.
   - Call `ScreenAbstractResultRepository.add()` (or a service method if preferred) to save `ScreenAbstractResult` records.
   - Call `SearchResultRepository.update()` to save changes to `models.SearchResult` instances (e.g., `conservative_result_id`).
   - Implement transaction management (`with session_factory.begin():`).
   - Implement error handling.
3. **Refactor `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/screen_abstracts.py`:**
   - Remove direct data loading for screening (keep for initial display if needed, but ensure models passed to service are fresh or by ID).
   - Replace direct call to `screen_abstracts_batch` with a call to the new `ScreeningService` method.
   - Update UI logic to use the results returned by the service.
4. **Refine Agent API (If Needed):**

5. **Write/Update Unit Tests (AC5, AC6, AC7, AC11):**
   - For the new `ScreeningService` method (mocking agent and repositories).
   - For `screen_abstracts.py` (mocking `ScreeningService`).
   - Ensure existing tests for `screening_agents.py` are still relevant and passing if its API is slightly adjusted.
   - **Note:** All mocking MUST use `pytest-mock` and its `mocker` fixture.
6. **Develop Integration Tests (AC8, AC9, AC11):**
   - Create integration tests for `ScreeningService.perform_batch_abstract_screening` in `tests/integration/app/test_services.py` (or a new relevant file) verifying DB interactions.
