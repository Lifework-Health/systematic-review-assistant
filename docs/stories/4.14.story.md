# Story 4.14: Improve Benchmark Screening Prompts for Conservative Decision-Making

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want to fine-tune the screening agent prompts to be more conservative in exclusion decisions, so that the AI screening system minimizes false negatives (incorrectly excluding relevant papers) in the benchmark evaluations.

**Context:** This story addresses critical feedback from human reviewers who observed the AI being too aggressive in exclusions during benchmark testing. The current prompts are resulting in excessive false negatives, where papers that should be included for full-text review are being excluded at the title/abstract screening stage. This story focuses on adjusting the screening agent prompts to adopt a more conservative stance, emphasizing that uncertainty should lead to inclusion rather than exclusion.

## Detailed Requirements

Based on human reviewer feedback from benchmark testing:

1. **"Absence of Evidence is Not Evidence of Absence"**: The AI should not exclude papers simply because certain information (e.g., country of study) is not explicitly mentioned in the abstract. When information is unclear or missing, err on the side of inclusion.

2. **Focus on Criteria Application**: The agents should directly apply the inclusion/exclusion criteria rather than trying to integrate or interpret through PICO framework concepts. While PICO provides helpful context, the actual screening decisions must be based on the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria.

3. **Cost of Errors**: The prompts must explicitly acknowledge that false negatives (excluding relevant papers) have a higher cost than false positives (including irrelevant papers) in systematic reviews.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: System prompts are updated to emphasize that "the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" (e.g., papers where the country of study is unclear should be included for full-text review rather than excluded).
- AC2: Conservative and comprehensive agent prompts focus on applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria directly rather than trying to integrate PICO framework concepts.
- AC3: Prompts explicitly state that the cost of false negatives (excluding relevant papers) is higher than false positives (including irrelevant papers).
- AC4: Resolver agent prompt is updated to be consistent with the more conservative approach.
- AC5: Benchmark re-run shows improved sensitivity (reduced false negatives) compared to baseline results.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in [`docs/coding-standards.md`](/docs/coding-standards.md) and understand the project structure in [`docs/project-structure.md`](/docs/project-structure.md). Only story-specific details are included below.

    **Benchmark Testing Results:**

    **Validation Completed:**
    1. **Integration Tests Passed**: All resolver and screening agent integration tests pass with real LLM calls, confirming updated prompts work correctly
    2. **Benchmark Data Seeded**: Successfully loaded 585 search results (220 included, 365 excluded in ground truth)
    3. **Prompt Validation**: Updated prompts now emphasize:
       - "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" principle
       - Conservative inclusion bias (false negatives > false positives in cost)
       - Direct criteria application rather than PICO interpretation
       - Clear examples of when to include despite missing information

    **Key Improvements Made:**
    - **Conservative Prompt**: Completely restructured to prioritize inclusion over exclusion
    - **Comprehensive Prompt**: Aligned with conservative approach while maintaining thoroughness
    - **Resolver Prompt**: Updated to favor inclusion when reviewers disagree
    - **All Prompts**: Added explicit cost-of-errors guidance and practical examples

    **Expected Performance Improvements:**
    - **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)**: Should increase due to more inclusive decision-making
    - **False Negatives**: Should decrease significantly with new "absence of evidence" guidance

    **Detailed Prompt Changes Documentation:**

    **1. Conservative Reviewer Prompt Changes:**

    **BEFORE** (Problematic - contradicted story requirements):
    ```
    "Consider unclear reporting as potential exclusion"
    "Interpret missing information as a reason for uncertainty"
    "Require explicit statements matching criteria"
    ```

    **AFTER** (Aligned with story requirements):
    ```
    ## Core Principle: "Absence of Evidence is Not Evidence of Absence"
    
    When information is unclear, missing, or not explicitly stated in the abstract, this is NOT grounds for exclusion. Instead:
    - Include papers when key information could be present in the full text
    - Default to inclusion when there is reasonable possibility the paper meets criteria
    
    ## Cost of Errors
    Remember: False negatives (excluding relevant papers) are more costly than false positives
    ```

    **2. Comprehensive Reviewer Prompt Changes:**

    **Key Addition**: Explicit alignment with conservative approach:
    ```
    ## Shared Core Principle: "Absence of Evidence is Not Evidence of Absence"
    Like your conservative counterpart, you must NOT exclude papers based on missing or unclear information
    ```

    **3. Resolver Prompt Changes:**

    **BEFORE**: General conflict resolution without inclusion bias

    **AFTER**: Strong inclusion bias with decision logic:
    ```
    ## Decision Logic Priority
    1. Both include: INCLUDE
    2. One includes, one excludes: INCLUDE (favor inclusion bias)
    3. Both uncertain: INCLUDE (uncertainty should not prevent full-text evaluation)
    4. Mixed uncertain/exclude: INCLUDE unless exclusion criteria clearly violated
    ```

    **Justification for Changes:**
    1. **Addresses Human Reviewer Feedback**: Directly responds to observed excessive false negatives
    2. **Follows Prompt Engineering Best Practices**: Uses clear structure, positive framing, and explicit examples
    3. **Implements Cost-Aware Decision Making**: Explicitly states that false negatives are more costly
    4. **Provides Practical Guidance**: Includes concrete examples of when to include despite missing information
