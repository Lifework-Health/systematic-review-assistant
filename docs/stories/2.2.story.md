# Story 2.2: Define and Implement Resolver Agent (Chain)

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I need a robust LLM agent (chain) utilizing the Gemini 2.5 Pro model that can take disagreement context or "both uncertain" scenarios as input and produce a final, deeply reasoned screening decision, so that conflicts can be resolved automatically and reliably.

**Context:** This story is part of Epic 2 ("Resolver Agent Implementation and Integration"). It focuses on creating the core AI logic for conflict resolution. This involves:
1. Reviewing and potentially refining the `ResolverOutputSchema` Pydantic schema.
2. Crafting a sophisticated LLM prompt for the `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` model, leveraging its inherent thinking capabilities and adhering to best practices outlined in `docs/prompt-engineering-guide.md`.
3. Constructing the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) chain, including specific model configurations like `thinking_budget`.
This chain will be invoked by the `ScreeningService` (Story 2.5) when disagreements or dual uncertainties are identified. The successful completion of Story 2.1, which defines `ResolverOutputSchema` and sets up data persistence, is a prerequisite. This story also builds upon insights from `docs/resolver-old-impl.md`.

## Detailed Requirements

(Partially Copied from `docs/epics/epic2-recovery-resolver-implementation.md#Story-2.2` and significantly enhanced)

- **DR1: `ResolverOutputSchema` Review and Refinement:**
    - Review and update the `ResolverOutputSchema` Pydantic schema in `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py`.
    - Specifically address the `resolver_include` field: evaluate its necessity and utility. The primary outcome is a definitive `final_decision` (as per FR5 of `docs/prd-resolver.md`).
    - If `resolver_include` (or a repurposed version like `contributing_strategies`) is retained, its name must be appropriate, and its type must be `list[ScreeningStrategyType]` (from `src/sr_assistant/core/types.py`), not `list[str]`.
    - Ensure the schema accurately reflects the data intended for populating/deriving the `ScreeningResolution` model, clearly distinguishing fields populated by the LLM from those populated by the service layer.

- **DR2: `resolver_prompt` Design and Implementation:**
    - Implement the `resolver_prompt` (system and human messages) in `src/sr_assistant/app/agents/screening_agents.py`.
    - **Model & Persona:** The prompt must be designed for the `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` model. It should assign the LLM an expert persona: "an expert systematic review screening assistant, an analytical critical deep thinker."
    - **Task Definition:** Clearly instruct the LLM its task is to resolve screening conflicts (when reviewers disagree) or ambiguities (when both reviewers are `uncertain`).
    - **Starting Point & Refinement Strategy:**
        - The prompt structure in `docs/resolver-old-impl.md` (using distinct sections for search result, review, and reviewer outputs) can serve as an initial reference.
        - **Critically analyze and refine this structure based on `docs/prompt-engineering-guide.md`.**
        - **Strongly consider using XML tags** (e.g., `<search_result>`, `<systematic_review>`, `<comprehensive_reviewer_result>`, `<conservative_reviewer_result>`) to clearly delimit and structure the various pieces of context provided to the Gemini model. This is a best practice for enhancing clarity and parsing accuracy for complex inputs.
    - **Encourage Deep Thinking (Gemini 2.5 Pro):**
        - Explicitly instruct the model to "think step by step," "show your work," "explain your reasoning comprehensively," "analyze the situation from all relevant perspectives," and "assume the reviewers' personas to better understand their reasoning." This is crucial as Gemini 2.5 models have inherent thinking capabilities that are active by default. The prompt must guide this process effectively.
        - The prompt should encourage the LLM to articulate its reasoning process before arriving at a final decision, potentially using a structured thinking block if beneficial (e.g., within `<thinking>...</thinking>` XML tags if that approach is chosen).
    - **Input Context:** The prompt must be able to take all necessary context, including:
        - `SearchResult` data (Title, Abstract, Source ID, Journal, Year, Keywords, MeSH terms).
        - `SystematicReview` protocol (Background, Research Question, Inclusion Criteria, Exclusion Criteria).
        - Details from both conservative and comprehensive reviewers: Decision, Confidence Score, Rationale, Extracted Quotes, and Exclusion Reasons (if applicable).
    - **Output Structure:** The prompt must align with the (potentially updated) `ResolverOutputSchema` for its output structure, emphasizing fields like `resolver_decision`, `resolver_reasoning`, and `resolver_confidence_score`.
    - **Gemini Specifics:** Note that `convert_system_message_to_human=True` will be used when configuring the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` client, so the system message content should be crafted accordingly.

- **DR3: `resolver_chain` Construction:**
    - Construct the `resolver_chain` in `src/sr_assistant/app/agents/screening_agents.py` using LCEL.
    - **Model Configuration:** Use `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` with the model `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`. Refer to the "Model Configuration" subsection in "Technical Implementation Context" for the detailed snippet. Key parameters include:
        - `temperature=0` (for consistent, deterministic outputs).
        - `max_tokens=None` (or an appropriate high limit if necessary, to allow for detailed reasoning).
        - `thinking_budget=24576` (to maximize the model\'s internal thinking/reasoning allocation).
        - `timeout=None` (or a reasonable timeout).
        - `max_retries=5`.
        - `api_key` (from settings).
        - `convert_system_message_to_human=True`.
    - **Structured Output:** Implement structured output parsing to the `ResolverOutputSchema`.
    - **Input Preparation:** Consider a helper function (similar to `make_resolver_chain_input` from `docs/resolver-old-impl.md`) to format the diverse input data into a consistent structure (e.g., dictionary of strings, or structured XML strings if that prompt strategy is chosen) for the prompt.

- **DR4: Error Handling and Retries:**
    - Implement robust error handling for the `resolver_chain`.
    - Utilize LangChain\'s built-in retry mechanisms (e.g., `.with_retry()`) for LLM calls.
    - **Ensure that the primary function/method responsible for invoking the `resolver_chain` is decorated with `@logger.catch` (from Loguru, similar to existing screening chain callbacks) to prevent exceptions from reaching the UI and ensure they are logged.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

(Derived from `docs/epics/epic2-recovery-resolver-implementation.md#Story-2.2` and updated)

- AC1: `ResolverOutputSchema` in `schemas.py` is correctly defined/updated per DR1. If a field like `resolver_include` is kept, it has an appropriate name and type (`list[ScreeningStrategyType]`).
- AC2: `resolver_prompt` is implemented in `screening_agents.py`, adheres to DR2 (including consideration of XML tags and principles from `docs/prompt-engineering-guide.md`), includes placeholders for all required context, encourages deep thinking, and aligns with the output schema.
- AC3: `resolver_chain` is defined in `screening_agents.py`, uses the `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` model with specified configurations (including `thinking_budget=24576` from the provided model definition snippet), the refined prompt, and structured output parsing to `ResolverOutputSchema`.
- AC4: The chain correctly processes realistically structured input data (formatted by a helper function or directly) and produces an output that successfully parses into a `ResolverOutputSchema` instance.
- AC5: Integration test for `resolver_chain` (running against the actual LLM API, using approved quotas) confirms it can be invoked with representative real context (disagreements and "both uncertain" scenarios) and returns an output that parses correctly to `ResolverOutputSchema`, with plausible and well-reasoned content.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`, `docs/naming-conventions.md`, and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Refer to `docs/api-reference.md` for service interactions and `docs/data-models.md` for schema details.

- **Relevant Files:**
    - Files to Modify:
        - `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` (for `ResolverOutputSchema` adjustments)
        - `src/sr_assistant/app/agents/screening_agents.py` (for `resolver_prompt` and `resolver_chain` implementation)
    - Files to Create (if not already stubs by Architect):
        - `tests/integration/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver.py` (for `resolver_chain` integration tests).
        - `tests/unit/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver_prompt.py` (for `resolver_prompt` or helper function unit tests).

- **Key Technologies:**
    - Python, LangChain (LCEL for chain construction, structured output parsing, prompt templates)
    - Pydantic (for `ResolverOutputSchema`)
    - Google AI API (Gemini models, via `langchain-google-genai`)

- **Model Configuration (RESOLVER_MODEL):**
  The `RESOLVER_MODEL` should be instantiated as follows, based on `docs/resolver-old-impl.md` and project settings. Note that the `with_structured_output` and `with_retry` calls are typically applied when constructing the full chain.
  ```python
  from pydantic import SecretStr # Assuming SecretStr is used for API keys
  from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
  # from sr_assistant.app.config import get_settings # Assuming settings provides the API key

  # This is the base model configuration.
  # The .with_structured_output(ResolverOutputSchema) and .with_retry(...)
  # will be added when building the resolver_chain.
  resolver_llm_instance = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
      model="gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06", # TODO: this should come from settings via env.
      temperature=0,
      max_tokens=None, # Allow model to use as many tokens as needed for reasoning.
      thinking_budget=24576, # Maximize thinking budget. TODO: also from settings.
      timeout=None, # Or a reasonable timeout.
      max_retries=5, # Handled by .with_retry(), but good for direct calls too.
      # api_key=get_settings().GOOGLE_API_KEY,  # Example if using settings
      convert_system_message_to_human=True, # Gemini doesn't support system prompts directly in same way as OpenAI
  )
  ```

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    - `langchain_google_genai.ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` for interacting with the `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` model.
    - LangChain\'s `ChatPromptTemplate` and a Pydantic-based output parser (e.g., `PydanticOutputFunctionsParser` or `JsonOutputParser` followed by Pydantic validation).

- **Data Structures for Chain Input (Example):**
    - The resolver chain will take a dictionary as input. This dictionary should be prepared by a helper function (e.g., `make_resolver_chain_input` from `docs/resolver-old-impl.md`), transforming raw data into formatted strings or structured content suitable for the prompt (potentially XML strings). Example keys:
        - `search_result_details: str` (formatted title, abstract, etc. Possibly as an XML block)
        - `review_protocol_details: str` (formatted research question, criteria. Possibly as an XML block)
        - `conservative_reviewer_input: str` (formatted decision, rationale, etc. Possibly as an XML block)
        - `comprehensive_reviewer_input: str` (formatted decision, rationale, etc. Possibly as an XML block)

- **`ResolverOutputSchema` (LLM Output Contract):**
    - LLM-populated fields: `resolver_decision: ScreeningDecisionType`, `resolver_reasoning: str`, `resolver_confidence_score: float`.
    - Field under review: `resolver_include: list[ScreeningStrategyType]` (or alternative).
    - Note: Fields like `id`, `review_id`, `search_result_id`, `conservative_result_id`, `comprehensive_result_id`, `response_metadata` are populated by the `ScreeningService` when creating the `ScreeningResolution` database model, not directly by the LLM chain\'s output schema.

- **Environment Variables:**
    - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (handled by `get_settings()` or direct environment variable access).
    - `RESOLVER_MODEL_NAME=\"gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06\"` (sourced from `src/sr_assistant/app/config.py` or settings).
    - `RESOLVER_THINKING_BUDGET=24576` (sourced from config/settings).

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
    - Follow standards in `docs/coding-standards.md`.
    - Prompts must be meticulously crafted as per DR2, ensuring clarity, context, and guidance for deep reasoning. The quality of the prompt directly impacts the resolver\'s performance.
    - Consider using XML tags for prompt structuring to enhance clarity for the Gemini model, as suggested in DR2 and `docs/prompt-engineering-guide.md`.
    - Ensure robust parsing of the LLM output into `ResolverOutputSchema`.
    - Implement retry mechanisms for LLM calls using `with_retry` from LangChain.

- **Project Structure Alignment:**
    - Resolver chain, prompt logic, and any input formatting helpers should reside in `src/sr_assistant/app/agents/screening_agents.py`.
    - `ResolverOutputSchema` updates in `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test the helper function(s) used for formatting input to the resolver prompt (especially if using XML structuring).
    - Test the construction of the `resolver_prompt` with various inputs to ensure it formats correctly and includes all necessary information.
    - Test the output parser for `ResolverOutputSchema` with sample valid and invalid LLM-like outputs.
- **Integration Tests:** (AC5)
    - Create integration tests for the `resolver_chain` that call the actual `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` LLM API.
    - These tests should use representative input data simulating:
        - Disagreements (e.g., INCLUDE vs. EXCLUDE, INCLUDE vs. UNCERTAIN).
        - "Both Uncertain" scenarios.
    - Verify that the output:
        - Successfully parses into a `ResolverOutputSchema` instance.
        - Produces a plausible and well-reasoned `resolver_decision` and `resolver_reasoning` given the inputs.
    - Ensure these tests are marked appropriately (e.g., with a pytest marker like `@pytest.mark.integration` and `@pytest.mark.llm_integration`) and manage API costs/quotas.
    - Refer to `docs/epics/epic3-recovery-testing-and-integrity.md#Story-3.2` for more details on resolver integration test scenarios, and adapt them for the Gemini model.

## Tasks / Subtasks

    - [x] Mark tests appropriately for managing API calls (`@pytest.mark.integration`, `@pytest.mark.llm_integration`, `skipif` for API key).

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)`
- **Completion Notes:**
    - Tasks 2.2.1 through 2.2.4 are complete.
    - The `ResolverOutputSchema` was updated: `resolver_include` was renamed to `contributing_strategies` and its type changed to `list[ScreeningStrategyType]`. Its utility is to indicate if the resolver's decision aligned with any of the original reviewer strategies.
    - The `resolver_prompt` was designed using XML tags for structuring context (search result, review protocol, reviewer assessments) as recommended by `docs/prompt-engineering-guide.md` and to enhance clarity for the Gemini model. It explicitly instructs the model to use a `<thinking>...</thinking>` block for its step-by-step reasoning before providing the structured output.
    - The `prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt` helper function was implemented to format inputs, including handling potentially missing `mesh_terms` by attempting to source them from `SearchResult.raw_data` (keys 'mesh_terms' or 'MeshHeadings') and defaulting to "N/A". The criteria framework used in the review is also now included in the prompt context.
    - The `resolver_chain` was constructed as `resolver_prompt | resolver_model`, where `resolver_model` is an instance of `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` configured for `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` with structured output parsing to `ResolverOutputSchema` and built-in retry mechanisms.
    - An `invoke_resolver_chain` function was created, decorated with `@logger.catch` for robust error handling and logging, as per project standards.
    - Task 2.2.5 (Unit Tests) is complete. Unit tests for helper functions, prompt formatting, and output schema parsing were implemented in `tests/unit/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver_prompt.py`. All unit tests are passing. Note: Some Pyright linter warnings (`reportPrivateUsage` for helper function tests and `reportArgumentType` for mock object usage) persist due to tool limitations in applying specific ignore comments; these are deemed acceptable for the current unit tests as the core logic is verified.
    - Task 2.2.6 (Integration Tests) structure has been created in `tests/integration/app/agents/test_screening_agents_resolver.py`, including test scenarios and data helpers. Targeted integration tests have been run successfully against the LLM API, confirming AC5. A minor adjustment was made to an assertion regarding confidence scores for 'UNCERTAIN' resolver decisions.

## Reviewer Comments (Technical Scrum Master/Engineering Lead)

**Review Date:** 2025-05-17
**Reviewer:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor) (Technical Scrum Master/Engineering Lead)

**Overall Assessment:** Approved. The implementation for Story 2.2 is excellent and meets all Acceptance Criteria and Detailed Requirements.

**Details:**
- **`ResolverOutputSchema` (AC1):** Correctly implemented, with `contributing_strategies` properly defined.
- **`resolver_prompt` & `resolver_chain` (AC2, AC3, DR2, DR3):**
    - The prompt design effectively uses XML tagging and includes explicit instructions for deep reasoning (e.g., `<thinking>` block), aligning with `docs/prompt-engineering-guide.md` principles.
    - The LCEL chain is correctly constructed with `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`, appropriate model parameters (including `thinking_budget=24576`), structured output to `ResolverOutputSchema`, and retry logic.
- **Input Preparation (DR3):** The `prepare_resolver_inputs_for_prompt` helper function is robust, handles various data inputs including N/A values and extraction of MeSH terms from `raw_data`.
- **Error Handling (DR4):** The `invoke_resolver_chain` function is correctly decorated with `@logger.catch` for robust error logging and UI protection.
- **Unit Tests (Task 2.2.5):** Comprehensive unit tests cover helper functions, prompt formatting, and output schema parsing. The use of file-level `# pyright: reportPrivateUsage=false` is appropriate as per `py/pyright-ignore-comments-agent`.
- **Integration Tests (AC5, Task 2.2.6):** Integration tests are well-structured, cover specified scenarios (disagreements, both uncertain), and correctly validate the chain's output against the live LLM API. The adjustment to confidence score assertions for 'UNCERTAIN' resolver decisions is sensible.
