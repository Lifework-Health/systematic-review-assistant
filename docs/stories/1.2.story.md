# Story 1.2: Refactor `SearchService` for PubMed Logic & Session Management

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `SearchService` in `services.py` to correctly manage all business logic for PubMed searches, including API interaction and database session lifecycle, using architecturally sound interfaces, so that search operations are reliable, maintainable, and adhere to the service layer pattern defined in `docs/api-reference.md`.

**Context:** This story is a critical part of Epic 1 ("Search and Service Layer Stabilization"). It focuses on refactoring the `SearchService` to be the single point of responsibility for PubMed search operations. This includes encapsulating PubMed API interactions, managing database sessions internally for its methods, and ensuring it correctly uses the `SearchResultRepository` (Story 1.3) and relevant Pydantic schemas like `schemas.SearchResultUpdate` (Story 1.5) and `schemas.SystematicReviewCreate`/`Update` (Story 2.1). This refactoring is essential for a stable and maintainable search functionality and for the correct operation of dependent components like `search.py` (Story 1.1).

**Reason for Reopening (2025-05-13):**
This story is being reopened to address an architectural refinement. Originally, `SearchService` methods were implemented to return `models.SearchResult` instances. To better align with API best practices and prevent leaking database models to the UI layer, these methods will be refactored to return `schemas.SearchResultRead` Pydantic objects instead. The service layer will be responsible for the conversion from model to schema. This change impacts method signatures, return types, and requires updates to associated tests.

## Detailed Requirements

(Copied from `docs/epics/epic1-recovery-search-stabilization.md#Story-1.2`)

1. **Encapsulate PubMed API Interaction:** `SearchService` must implement the `search_pubmed_and_store_results` method. This method will:
    * Accept `review_id`, `query`, and `max_results`.
    * Internally handle all aspects of querying the PubMed API (e.g., using BioPython Entrez or a similar HTTP client mechanism).
    * Fetch raw results from PubMed.
    * Utilize the internal `_map_pubmed_to_search_result` method to transform raw PubMed records into `models.SearchResult` instances.
    * Ensure `SearchResult` instances are correctly populated (e.g., `source_db='PubMed'`, `source_id=PMID`, `year` as `str | None`).
    * Store these `SearchResult` instances using `SearchResultRepository.add_all` (or similar batch method).
    * Convert the stored `models.SearchResult` instances to `schemas.SearchResultRead` Pydantic objects before returning.
2. **Session Management:**
    * All public methods in `SearchService` (including the new `search_pubmed_and_store_results`, `get_search_results_by_review_id`, `get_search_result_by_source_details`, `update_search_result`, `delete_search_result`) MUST manage their own database sessions internally (e.g., using `with self.session_factory() as session:`). The `session: Session | None` parameter MUST be removed from all public method signatures.
    * The internally managed session MUST be passed to any `SearchResultRepository` methods called.
3. **Update Method Signature and Logic:**
    * The `update_search_result` method signature MUST be changed from `(self, result_update: models.SearchResult, ...)` to `(self, result_id: uuid.UUID, update_data: schemas.SearchResultUpdate, ...)` as per `docs/api-reference.md`. Internally, it will fetch the `models.SearchResult` by `result_id`, apply updates from `update_data`, save, and then return the corresponding `schemas.SearchResultRead` object.
4. **Method Removal:**
    * The existing `add_api_search_results` method MUST be removed. Its functionality is superseded by the properly encapsulated `search_pubmed_and_store_results`.
5. **Internal Mapping Methods:**
    * Ensure `_map_pubmed_to_search_result` and `_map_scopus_to_search_result` have correct type hints (`api_record: dict[str, Any]`).
    * Verify mapping logic aligns with `models.SearchResult` (e.g., `year` as `str | None`). The linter error regarding `year` being `int` in the mapper vs `str` in the model needs to be resolved by ensuring the mapper provides a string.
6. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for PubMed API interactions and database operations within the service methods.
7. **Linter Errors:** Resolve all linter errors within the `SearchService` code block in `services.py` after refactoring.
8. **`ReviewService` Session Management:**
    * All public methods in `ReviewService` (`create_review`, `get_review`, `get_all_reviews`, `update_review`, `delete_review`) MUST manage their own database sessions internally. The `session: Session | None` parameter MUST be removed from their public signatures.
    * The internally managed session MUST be passed to any `SystematicReviewRepository` methods called.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

* **Relevant Files:**
    * Files to Modify: `src/sr_assistant/app/services.py` (for `SearchService` and `ReviewService` refactoring)
    * Files to Modify: `src/sr_assistant/app/pages/protocol.py` (to align `ReviewService` calls)

* **Key Technologies:**
    * Python, SQLModel, SQLAlchemy (for session management)
    * Pydantic (for `schemas.SearchResultUpdate`, `schemas.SystematicReviewCreate`, `schemas.SystematicReviewUpdate`)
    * BioPython Entrez (or equivalent for PubMed API interaction)

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
    * PubMed API (via Entrez or HTTP client)
    * Internal `SearchResultRepository` API (methods from Story 1.3)
    * Internal `SystematicReviewRepository` API

* **Data Structures & Model Definitions:**
    * `models.SearchResult` (from `src/sr_assistant/core/models.py`)
    * `schemas.SearchResultRead` (from `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` - this is the expected return type for relevant service methods)
    * `schemas.SearchResultUpdate` (from `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` - Story 1.5)
    * `schemas.SystematicReviewCreate` (from `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` - Story 2.1)
    * `schemas.SystematicReviewUpdate` (from `src/sr_assistant/core/schemas.py` - Story 2.1)
    * `docs/api-reference.md#SearchService` and `docs/api-reference.md#ReviewService` for target method signatures.

* **Environment Variables:**
    * `NCBI_API_KEY` (if direct Entrez usage requires it and it's not already handled by a config module). Check existing PubMed interaction logic.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
    * Internal session management pattern:
    ```python
    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker # SQLModel uses Session from sqlmodel, not orm
    from sqlmodel import Session # Correct import for SQLModel session
    from sr_assistant.app.database import session_factory as app_main_session_factory # Example import for the app's factory
    from sr_assistant.core import schemas # Added for SearchResultRead

    # In service __init__
    class YourService:
        def __init__(self, factory: sessionmaker[Session] = app_main_session_factory, other_dependencies...):
            self.session_factory: sessionmaker[Session] = factory
            # self.repo = other_dependencies.repo etc.
    
        # In service method
        def some_method(self, ...):
            with self.session_factory() as session: # session will be of type sqlmodel.Session
                # Perform operations with session
                # repo_result = self.repository.some_method(session, ...)
                # ... potentially convert repo_result (model instance) to a Pydantic schema ...
                # e.g., result_schema = schemas.YourReadSchema.model_validate(repo_result, from_attributes=True) # Ensure from_attributes=True
                session.commit() # Or handle transaction as needed (e.g. for writes)
                # return result_schema
    ```
    * Ensure `_map_pubmed_to_search_result` correctly handles potential missing fields from API records to prevent errors when populating `models.SearchResult`, especially for optional fields like `year`.
    * `year` in `models.SearchResult` should be `str | None`. The mapping function must ensure this.

* **Project Structure Alignment:**
    * All service logic resides in `src/sr_assistant/app/services.py`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

* **Unit Tests:** (in `tests/unit/app/test_services.py`)
    * **`SearchService`:**
        * Test `search_pubmed_and_store_results`:
            * Mock PubMed API call (e.g., `Entrez.efetch`, `Entrez.esearch`).
            * Mock `_map_pubmed_to_search_result`.
            * Mock `SearchResultRepository.add_all` (or equivalent batch add method from Story 1.3).
            * Verify internal session management (mock `session_factory`, check `begin`, `commit`/`rollback`, `close` calls).
            * Verify correct parameters passed to mocks.
            * Verify the method returns a sequence of `schemas.SearchResultRead` objects.
            * Test error handling for API failures and repository failures.
        * Test `update_search_result`:
            * Mock `SearchResultRepository.get_by_id` and `SearchResultRepository.update`.
            * Verify that data from `schemas.SearchResultUpdate` is correctly applied to the fetched `models.SearchResult` instance before `update` is called.
            * Verify internal session management.
            * Verify the method returns a `schemas.SearchResultRead` object.
        * Test other public methods (`get_search_results_by_review_id`, `get_search_result_by_source_details`) for correct session passing to repository mocks and that they return `schemas.SearchResultRead` or `Sequence[schemas.SearchResultRead]` as appropriate.
        * Test `_map_pubmed_to_search_result`:
            * Provide sample raw PubMed API records (as dicts).
            * Verify correct mapping to `models.SearchResult`, especially for `source_db`, `source_id`, `title`, `abstract`, and `year` (as `str | None`). Handle cases where fields might be missing in the API response.
        * Test that input Pydantic schemas (`SystematicReviewCreate`, `SystematicReviewUpdate`) are handled correctly.
    * **`ReviewService`:**
        * For each public method (`create_review`, `get_review`, `get_all_reviews`, `update_review`, `delete_review`):
            * Mock the corresponding `SystematicReviewRepository` method.
            * Verify internal session management (mock `session_factory`, check `begin`, `commit`/`rollback`, `close` calls).
            * Verify correct parameters passed to repository mocks.
            * Test that input Pydantic schemas (`SystematicReviewCreate`, `SystematicReviewUpdate`) are handled correctly.
* **Integration Tests:**
    * Consider a TDD-like approach, potentially starting with an integration test for each key service method, then elaborating with unit tests.
    * Integration tests for PubMed search functionality (AC9) will involve actual API calls to PubMed (consider rate limiting, using a test API key if available, and testing with small `max_results`). These tests should verify that `SearchService.search_pubmed_and_store_results` correctly fetches, maps, stores data, and returns `schemas.SearchResultRead` objects.
    * Integration tests for `ReviewService` methods will verify interactions with the actual database.

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

* **Agent Model Used:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)
* **Completion Notes (Reopened Story):**
    * **Task 1.2.13 (Refactor SearchService for SearchResultRead):**
        * All specified public methods in `SearchService` (`search_pubmed_and_store_results`, `get_search_results_by_review_id`, `get_search_result_by_source_details`, `update_search_result`) were refactored. Their return type hints were updated to `schemas.SearchResultRead` or `Sequence[schemas.SearchResultRead]` as appropriate.
        * Logic was added at the return points of these methods to convert `models.SearchResult` instances to `schemas.SearchResultRead` using `schemas.SearchResultRead.model_validate(model_instance, from_attributes=True)`. The explicit `from_attributes=True` was necessary for Pydantic to correctly convert from the SQLModel ORM instances. This resolved initial `ValidationError`s related to Pydantic expecting a dictionary or a `SearchResultRead` instance rather than a raw ORM model.
        * A key discovery during the `update_search_result` refactoring was the mapping between `schemas.SearchResultUpdate.screening_decision` and `models.SearchResult.final_decision`. The service logic in `SearchService.update_search_result` was corrected to ensure that when `screening_decision` is provided in the update payload, the `final_decision` field on the `models.SearchResult` instance is updated. Previously, an attempt to set a non-existent `screening_decision` field on the model would have failed silently or explicitly depending on model configuration.
    * **Task 1.2.14 (Update Tests for SearchService):**
        * Unit tests in `tests/unit/app/test_services.py` for the affected `SearchService` methods were extensively updated and debugged.
        * Mock `models.SearchResult` instances used in tests were made more complete. A significant issue was Pydantic's strict validation for `AwareDatetime` fields; mock data for `created_at` and `updated_at` was changed from `datetime.utcnow()` (naive) to `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` (timezone-aware) to resolve `ValidationError`s.
        * The `test_update_search_result_success` required several iterations. The final error was an `AssertionError` due to a mismatch between the field being set on the model (`final_decision`) and the field being asserted in the test logic for the mock object passed to the repository. This was corrected by ensuring the test mock `models.SearchResult` instantiations for `original_model` and `expected_model_after_repo_update_and_refresh` used the correct field name `final_decision` and did not include fields not present on the `models.SearchResult` database model (like `screening_rationale`, `tags`, `notes`). The assertion for the argument passed to `mock_repo.update` was also updated to check `updated_model_arg.final_decision`.
        * After these corrections, all unit tests for `SearchService` now pass.
        * Integration tests were not run or modified as part of this task.
    * **Linter Issues & Tooling:** Encountered persistent issues with the editing tool incorrectly reporting or reintroducing SLF001 linter errors (protected member access in tests). These were eventually ignored after multiple unsuccessful attempts to fix them via `noqa` comments, as they did not affect test functionality and all tests passed.
* **Change Log:**
    * Initial Draft
    * 2025-05-13 (Gemini 2.5 Pro): Added Code Review Summary section.
    * 2025-05-13 (Gemini 2.5 Pro): Story marked as Done after code review.
    * 2025-05-13 (Gemini 2.5 Pro): Reopened story. Added new requirement and tasks (1.2.13, 1.2.14) to refactor SearchService methods to return Pydantic `schemas.SearchResultRead` instead of `models.SearchResult` and update all associated tests. Updated relevant sections (Status, Context, Requirements, ACs, Technical Context, Testing Requirements). Original completion notes and review summary are now historical; new ones will be needed after re-completion.
    * 2025-05-13 (Gemini 2.5 Pro): Completed tasks 1.2.13 and 1.2.14. `SearchService` methods now return `schemas.SearchResultRead`. Unit tests updated and passing after several debugging iterations. Story status updated to Review.
    * 2025-05-13 (Claude 3.7 Sonnet): Fixed integration tests to handle Pydantic schemas from service methods. Story status marked as Done.

## Code Review Summary (2025-05-13 by Claude 3.7 Sonnet)

**Overall Assessment:** The implementation of Story 1.2 (including the reopened changes) has been completed successfully. The service layer now correctly returns Pydantic schemas instead of SQLModel database models, ensuring proper encapsulation and separation of concerns between the service and UI layers.

**Key Review Points:**

1. **Service Method Return Types:** All specified `SearchService` methods now return `schemas.SearchResultRead` or `Sequence[schemas.SearchResultRead]` objects instead of raw SQLModel instances.

2. **Schema Conversion:** The conversion from models to schemas is done correctly using `schemas.SearchResultRead.model_validate(model_instance, from_attributes=True)`. The crucial `from_attributes=True` flag is consistently used to properly convert from SQLModel instances.

3. **Data Integrity:** The services appropriately handle the mapping of schema fields to model fields, especially in the `update_search_result` method where `screening_decision` in the update schema is mapped to `final_decision` in the database model.

4. **Testing Updates:**
   * Unit tests have been thoroughly updated to verify the return of schema objects and properly handle validation of fields, including timezone-aware datetime fields.
   * Integration tests have been fixed to reflect the removal of the deprecated `add_api_search_results` method and to properly handle Pydantic schema returns from service methods.
   * All tests now verify the correct type of returned objects (schemas) and their field values.

5. **Documentation:** Docstrings and comments have been updated to reflect the return type changes and explain the schema conversion.

**Issues Found and Fixed:**

1. Integration tests were calling methods with explicit `session` parameters, which have been removed from the service methods. This was fixed by removing the session parameters from test calls.

2. Two obsolete integration tests were using the removed `add_api_search_results` method. These were clearly marked as skipped with an explanation.

3. Test assertions needed to check for `schemas.SearchResultRead` instances instead of model instances, which was updated across all tests.

4. In the `search_pubmed_and_store_results` integration test, additional assertions were added to verify that the service returns Pydantic schemas and that the schema data matches the database model data.

**Conclusion:** All acceptance criteria have been met. The story implementation successfully refactors the `SearchService` to use internal session management, properly encapsulate PubMed operations, and return Pydantic schemas (`schemas.SearchResultRead`) instead of database models. The comprehensive test coverage confirms the correct behavior of all refactored components.

The changes align well with the defined architectural patterns and will make the codebase more maintainable, particularly as the UI layer can now rely on consistently structured data from the service layer without directly accessing the database models.

## Deviations from Epic (If Any)

*(To be filled if the implementation deviates from the epic definition)*
