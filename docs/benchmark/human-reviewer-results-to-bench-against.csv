Abdel-Baki, Canada","Substance use disorders (SUD) in first-episode psychosis (FEP) are highly prevalent and linked with poor outcomes. However, most longitudinal studies investigating their impacts in FEP have not reported proportions of patients who ceased SUD. Our aim was to examine the influence of SUD course on functional and symptomatic outcomes as well as service use in FEP. We performed a 2-year longitudinal study of 212 FEP patients, aged between 18 and 30 years, admitted to 2 early psychosis services in MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec, Canada. We observed that cannabis was the first substance abused (42.9% at baseline), followed by alcohol (19.3%). The SUD rate decreased by approximately 30% during the first year. Patients with persistent SUD had worse functional outcomes (Quality of Life Scale, Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, employment), more symptoms (Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale) and heavier service use (emergency and hospitalization). SUD persistence was associated with illness severity, homelessness and cluster-B personality. Those living with their parents and financially supported by them were more likely to cease SUD. Our results indicate that SUD course was more significant than having SUD at admission; persistent SUD was associated with worse outcomes. SUD decreased during a general early psychosis intervention program (with no specialized SUD treatment). An integrated, specialized approach targeting FEP patients with predictive factors of SUD persistence during the first years of treatment might increase SUD cessation and possibly improve outcomes.","L613334122     2016-12-06     2016-12-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2016.11.007,adult;alcohol abuse;article;Canada;cannabis addiction;controlled clinical trial;controlled study;disease severity;drug dependence;early intervention;emergency care;employment;family relation;female;functional status;health program;homelessness;hospitalization;human;longitudinal study;major clinical study;male;outcome assessment;Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale;priority journal;Quality of Life Scale;rating scale;Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale;social status;symptomatology;Psychotic Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

PCLP services can provide early intervention aimed at reducing or preventing the impact of MH problems in adulthood [1]. The project aimed to compare the type of ED presentations and interventions by PCLP between Temple Street Children's University Hospital (TSCUH) and Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin (OLCHC) over a one-month period (November 2016). Clinical data was retrieved from all case notes using a study specific questionnaire and the Paddington Complexity Scale. There were 42 presentations during the audit period, one patient presented twice. More than half of the 31 from TSCUH, presented with deliberate self- harm (53%, N =17) compared to 27% (3) from OLCHC. Suicidal ideation was present in 53% (16) of TSCUH and 73%(8) in the OLCHC. In both hospitals, a mood disorder was the most prominent Axis I diagnosis, 73% in TSCUH and 71% OLCHC. There was a significant difference in the proportion of cases admitted, with 82% (9) admitted in OLCHC, compared to 41% (13) in TSCUH (p = 0.018). Similarly, there was significantly more multi-disciplinary involvement in TSCUH (66% moderate, 21) compared to 91% (10) minimal in OLCHC (p â‰¤ 0.000 ). The teams at TSCUH and OLCHC differ in their composition and approach, which requires further research given that the hospitals willmerge into the New Children's Hospital and will require a standardised approach.","L619737139     2017-12-20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1007/s11845-017-1711-z,"adult;adulthood;automutilation;child;clinical article;consultation;controlled study;diagnosis;early intervention;emergency ward;female;homeless youth;human;liaison psychiatry;mood disorder;physical disability;questionnaire;suicidal ideation;university hospital;Emergency Service, Hospital;Referral and Consultation;Emergencies",,,N,N,Full text screen

Acheampong, Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States","Aims: This analysis examines exposure to violence and substance use disorders among women in drug court who are: current sex traders (CST), former sex traders (FST), or women who have never traded sex. Methods: Data comes from 319 women recruited from a Municipal Drug Court System in the Midwest. Women were interviewed about sex trading, violence, and drug use. Women who traded sex in the past 4 months for drugs, alcohol, or other resources were classified as CST, while women who previously traded sex but not in the past 4 months were classified as FST. Multinomial logistic regression determined the association between DSM-IV substance use disorder, violence, and current sex trading. Results: Women were equally divided by trading status: 31% CST, 35% FST, and 34% never traded. Being physically attacked and emotionally abused in the past 4 months were significantly associated with sex trading status-whereas CST reported the highest rates. DSM-IV alcohol, opioid, and cocaine use disorders were also significantly associated with sex trading status and greater in CST. In an adjusted multinomial model, having at least one instance of violence increased the odds of CST (AOR 27.7) and FST (AOR 9.9) compared to those who did not report an instance of violence. Meeting the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol use disorder (CST: AOR 2.60; FST AOR: 2.59) and cocaine use disorder (CST: AOR 22.24; FST: AOR 22.17) also predicted sex trading status. Other significant variables were: having less than a high school diploma (CST: AOR 4.54; FST AOR: 2.41), 75+ lifetime sexual partners (CST: AOR 27.70; FST AOR: 9.78), and unstable housing (CST: AOR 4.33; FST AOR: 3.60). Conclusions: Future interventions should take into account the uneven rates of alcohol/drug use and violence in this population. Interventions tailored specifically to CST and FST are needed.","L72176394     2016-02-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.07.925,cocaine;alcohol;opiate;violence;female;human;college;drug dependence;substance abuse;diseases;logistic regression analysis;model;alcoholism;high school;lifespan;population;housing;sexuality;drug use;exposure;Violence,,,N,N,Full text screen

Afungchwi, Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Services, Childhood Cancer Program, Kumbo, Cameroon","Background/Objectives: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the most common childhood cancer in Cameroon. Patients receive free treatment in Banso Baptist Hospital (BBH) in northwest Cameroon. Parental support is provided for transport (CFA 10,000 or 20 USD) and meals during their child's hospitalization. Nursing care includes tracking patient adherence to treatment and following-up. This study aims to assess the degree of patient destitution and its effects on adherence to treatment and outcome for BL. Design/Methods: This was a prospective cohort study including BL patients less than 15 years admitted in BBH from 2010-2014. A questionnaire was administered to assess household capacity; monthly income; access to food and basic commodities; and dependence on support from others for daily living. A destitution score was awarded on a scale of 1 to 10. Data was analyzed with IBM SPSS Version 21. Pearson's coefficient and Chi-square were used to assess correlations and associations. Results: Of 140 respondents, 59% were male, and the mean age was 8.54years. The majority (69%) were farmers, and 80% had a monthly revenue of less than CFA50,000(USD 100). The mean social destitution score was 5.61(SD 0.957). A 93% of the children completed chemotherapy, although 17% were delayed for their chemotherapy at least once. Over half (59%) were alive at the end of 2014, and 62% came for regular follow-up visits. There was no correlation between destitution score and adherence to chemotherapy schedules (p=0.2), nor remission (p=0.2). There was a significant inverse correlation between destitution score and post-treatment follow-up visits (p=0.02). Conclusion: Adherence to treatment is appropriate, even when parents are destitute (93%). We believe this is probably due to financial support for transport and meals. A low destitution score may indicate which patients may abscond from follow-up visits. This may be attributable to a lack of access to transportation funding post treatment.","L612592711     2016-11-11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/pbc.26233,agricultural worker;Baptist;Burkitt lymphoma;chemotherapy;child;cohort analysis;data analysis software;drug therapy;female;financial management;follow up;funding;homelessness;household;human;major clinical study;male;nursing care;questionnaire;remission;school child;Only Child;Lymphoma;Child,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Dublin Dental University Hospital, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.","OBJECTIVE: To understand why, how and under what circumstances interventions lead to improved access of young adults with experience of homelessness (YAEH) to primary care dental services in the UK. METHODS: We followed a realist, theory-driven methodology. It involved locating existing theories, searching for evidence, document selection, data extraction/appraisal and evidence synthesis. We searched scientific databases and grey literature sources. We used these data and relevant substantive theories to develop explanations of how, why and under what circumstances interventions lead to desired outcomes. We presented these explanations in the form of context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs). The CMOCs were incorporated in an overarching programme theory, which was iteratively developed and refined throughout the realist synthesis. RESULTS: We used 106Â scientific and 18Â grey literature records to synthesize 61 CMOCs. Our revised programme theory highlights the importance of four main considerations: 'preparing a service', 'producing and disseminating information', 'outreach activities' and 'facilitating interactions'. When designing dental programmes for YAEH, we recommend considering the importance of prior service planning (including resourcing of emergency dental care, training staff and incorporating safety measures), creating positive experiences, flexibility, patient-centeredness, being informative and reassuring, creating an enabling environment (including strong communication, building rapport and avoiding negative judgements), having realistic expectations and designing services that empower patients. CONCLUSIONS: Improving dental access of YAEH requires attention to multiple levels. Services can achieve positive outcomes by understanding the complexity of YAEH lives, and creating contextual circumstances that encourage their attendance.","1600-0528     Ahmadyar, Maryam     Orcid: 0000-0002-4501-1163     Rai, Tanvi     Daly, Blanaid     Wong, Geoffrey     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Denmark     Community Dent Oral Epidemiol. 2022 Oct;50(5):437-444. doi: 10.1111/cdoe.12695.

Furthermore, the population prevalence of injection drug use among youth is also on the rise. This short communication examines the association between current prescription drug misuse (PDM) and injection among runaway and homeless youth. Methods: Homeless youth were surveyed between October 2011 and February 2012 at two drop-in service agencies in Los Angeles, CA. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (Cl) for the association between current PDM and injection behavior were estimated. The outcome of interest was use of a needle to inject any illegal drug into the body during the past 30 days. Results: Of 380 homeless youth (median age, 21; IQR, 17-25; 72% male), 84(22%) reported current PDM and 48 (13%) reported currently injecting. PDM during the past 30 days was associated with a 7.7 (95% CI: 4.4, 13.5) fold increase in the risk of injecting during that same time. Among those reporting current PDM with concurrent heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine use, the PR with injection was 15.1 (95% CI: 8.5, 26.8). Conclusions: Runaway and homeless youth are at increased risk for a myriad of negative outcomes. Our preliminary findings are among the first to show the strong association between current PDM and injection in this population. Our findings provide the basis for additional research to delineate specific patterns of PDM and factors that enable or inhibit transition to injection among homeless and runaway youth.

Alhuwail, Information Science Department, Kuwait University, Sabah AlSalem University, City, P.O. Box 5969, Safat, Kuwait","Background: Mental disorders are a major public health problem leading to premature mortality, homelessness, addiction problems, poor physical health, and suicide. The prevalence of mental disorders in Arab countries, is high. The proliferation and ubiquity of smartphones and their apps in the Arab world may be the long-awaited for digital therapeutic for mental health disorders. However, the evidence about the availability and characteristics of mental health apps available to Arabic speakers remains poor. Objective: To conduct a systematic assessment of the features of depression and anxiety mobile apps available for Arabic speakers. Methods: A critical review of all the currently available depression and anxiety apps, available free of charge to Arabic speakers. The apps are evaluated using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). Further, a categorization of appsâ€™ main functions, inspired by the mhGAP guidelines, is developed to classify the apps based on their main functions. Results: A total of 23 apps are identified with far more apps available on the Google Play Store (n = 21) versus only two apps on the iOS App Store. The majority of the apps (n = 16) provide general information about either anxiety, depression, or both. Six apps are of spiritual nature mainly referring to the Islamic faith and the Holy Quran, with one app referring to the Christian faith. Another five apps provide advice on alternative treatments, mainly concerning herbal medicine recipes. Only two apps provided utilities for users, specifically about medication reminders. Conclusions: Mental health digi-threaputics have huge potentials to transform mental health care delivery. However, more empirical studies are needed to assure their quality and efficacy. The results of this study clearly highlight the current gaps to address the needs of Arabic speakers; only 23 apps were identified in this study, mostly with low app quality scores. There is a need to involve expert healthcare professionals in the development of mental health apps and for healthcare providers to empower patients through discussing apps that are useful and discern them from those that can potentially cause harm.","L2004512162     2020-01-08     2020-01-15 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.104056,anxiety;article;classification;consumer health informatics;depression;happiness;health care delivery;herbal medicine;human;mental disease;mental health;mental health care;mental stress;mobile application;mood;practice guideline;priority journal;rating scale;sadness;physiological stress;systematic review;Arabs;Anxiety,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Ana, Charleston VAMC and MUSC, Charleston, SC, United States","Aims: We evaluated whether a motivational interviewing component targeting smoking behaviors combined with an existing manualized Group Motivational Interviewing intervention, referred to as 'Tobacco-GMI' (T-GMI), would increase treatment engagement in smoking cessation programming and improve use of NRT compared to GMI (alone- without smoking cessation component) in nicotine dependent homeless veterans. Methods: Thirty-seven homeless veterans with alcohol and nicotine use disorder and co-existing psychiatric disorders were recruited to receive four GMI sessions over four consecutive days. The first 16 participants received standard 'GMI' alone, aimed at enhancing engagement in substance abuse treatment and reducing substance use, while the remaining 21 participants received a 'smoking cessation-enhanced' GMI protocol ('T-GMI') that included additional content specific to cessation of tobacco use and smoking treatment along with standard GMI. Results: Between group differences at baseline were NS for age, cigarettes smoked per day, CO levels, FTND scores, number of reported smoking quit attempts, and years of smoking. 8 of 21 participants (62%) in T-GMI attended one or more smoking cessation classes, compared to only 1 of 16 participants (7%) in GMI; a finding that showed a trend towards significance (Fischer exact test, p = .05). Within T-GMI, 10 participants (48%) received a prescription for NRT smoking medication compared to 3 participants (19%) in GMI, although this difference was not significant (Fischer exact test, p < .10). Within T-GMI, 6 participants (29%) attended at least one smoking cessation class combined with NRT, compared to 0 participants in GMI (Fisher exact test, p = .03). Conclusions: The T-GMI intervention enhanced treatment engagement among homeless veterans with alcohol and nicotine use disorder with regard to greater attendance in smoking cessation classes alone and for significantly enhancing COMBINED smoking cessation classes- with prescribed (NRT) smoking cessation medications.","L618520445     2017-10-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.499,alcohol;nicotine;reducing agent;alcoholism;clinical article;controlled study;Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence;female;Fisher exact test;human;male;motivational interviewing;prescription;smoking cessation;substance abuse;tobacco dependence;veteran;Tobacco Use Disorder;Substance-Related Disorders,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

There have been few studies on this population. It is aimed at finding factors predicting methamphetamine use among homeless people in Bangkok. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted among 213 homeless people recruited via snowball sampling with face to face quantitative and qualitative interviews. All questions were evaluated for content validity prior to the fielding of the study. Results: Among the sample, predominantly male (66%), there was a mean age of 29 years. Nearly all (93%) lived in parks, at the train or bus station, under a bridge or in a temple. About 40% reported income of less than 500 Baht/month (about 17 US$). More than half (62%) reported lifetime use of at least 1 drug with 14% reporting being a drug dealer. The majority reported that the number one reason for homelessness was peer pressure to leave (31%).A history of methamphetamine use was common among the sample: 26.3% reported use and 73.7% reported no use. The factors associated with methamphetamine use, vs no use, were cannabis use (43% vs 9%, heroin use (18% vs 2%), inhalant use (55% vs 8%), binge drinking in the last 7 days (36% vs 10%), male gender (70% vs 64%), violence (18% vs 13%), peer pressure (29% vs 2%), and having traded sex (38% vs 24%). The logistic regression using STATA found that cannabis, heroin and inhalant use, as well as binge drinking in the last 7 days were significantly associated with methamphetamine use. Additionally, having a peerwhoinfluenced them to leave home was strongly associated with methamphetamine use. Conclusions: These data point to specific prevention and intervention strategies for people who are homeless in Thailand.","L618520284     2017-10-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.041,cannabis;diamorphine;methamphetamine;adult;binge drinking;cannabis use;clinical trial;content validity;cross-sectional study;female;gender;homeless person;homelessness;human;interview;male;peer pressure;sampling;Thailand;violence;Methamphetamine;Fibrinogen,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Assoumou, Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, 801 Massachusetts Ave., Crosstown Center, 2nd Floor, Boston, MA, United States","Background: The US opioid crisis is associated with a surge in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among persons who inject drugs (PWID), and yet the uptake of HCV curative therapy among PWID is low. Purpose: To explore potential solutions to overcome barriers to HCV treatment uptake among individuals at a drug detoxification center. Methods: Qualitative study with in-depth interviews and thematic analysis of coded data. Results: Patients (N = 24) had the following characteristics: mean age 37 years; 67 % White, 13 % Black, 8 % Latinx, 4 % Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 8 % other; 71 % with a history of injecting drugs. Most patients with a positive HCV test had not pursued treatment due to few perceived immediate consequences from a positive test and possible complications arising in a distant poorly imagined future. Active substance use was a major barrier to HCV treatment uptake because of disruptions to routine activities. In addition, re-infection after treatment was perceived as inevitable. Patients had suggestions to improve HCV treatment uptake: high-intensity wraparound care characterized by frequent interactions with supportive services; same-day/walk-in options; low-barrier access to substance use treatment; assistance with navigating the health care system; attention to immediate needs, such as housing; and the opportunity to select an approach that best fits individual circumstances. Conclusions: Active substance use was a major barrier to treatment initiation. To improve uptake, affected individuals recommended that HCV treatment be integrated within substance use treatment programs. Such a model should incorporate patient education within low-barrier, high-intensity wraparound care, tailored to patientsâ€™ needs and priorities.","L2010701984     2021-01-27     2021-02-04 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108526,diamorphine;abstinence;aged;article;attitude to health;Black person;bloodstream infection;Caucasian;clinical article;condom use;drug dependence;drug detoxification;educational status;fear;female;health care need;health care system;health education;hepatitis C;homelessness;human;infection risk;injection drug user;interview;male;Native Hawaiian;needle sharing;Pacific Islander;patient attitude;priority journal;qualitative research;reinfection;self report;substance use;unemployment;very elderly;withdrawal syndrome,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: Data on consecutive presentations to Irish emergency departments (EDs) involving self-harm from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland from 2004 to 2012 were utilised. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between patientsâ€™ clinical and demographic characteristics, and recommended next care received. Results: Across the study period a total 101,904 self-harm presentations were made to hospital EDs, involving 63,457 individuals. Over the course of the study there was a declining number of presentations resulting in patient admission following attendance with self-harm. Recommended next care varied according to hospital location, with general admission rates ranging from 11% to 61% across administrative health regions. Multinomial logistic regression identified that the factor which most strongly affected next care was the presenting hospital. Being male, older age, method, repeat self-harm, time of attendance and residence of the patient were all identified as influencing care received. Psychiatric admission was most common when highly lethal methods of self-harm were used (OR = 4.00, 95% CI, 3.63â€“4.41). A relatively large proportion of patients left the ED without being seen (15%) and the risk of doing so was highest for self-harm repeaters (1.64, 1.55â€“1.74 for those with 5+ presentations). Conclusions: The extensive hospital variation in recommended next care indicates that management of self-harm patients may be determined more by where they present than by the needs of the patient. The study outcomes underline the need to standardise the clinical management of self-harm patients in general hospital settings.

Community-based screening initiatives, such as HepCheck, have been identified as important components of HCV care. HepCheck focuses on screening and identifying HCV RNA-positive cases in high-risk populations and linking them to care as part of a larger European project to improve HCV care (HepCare). Methods: HCV testing with a self-administered questionnaire was offered to 2822 individuals. Results: There were 2079 patients screened. Overall, 397 (19%) of the total screened cohort were identified as having active HCV infections as measured by HCV RNA PCR. The patients were mostly male (84%), white (88%), and had a history of injecting drug use (IDU) (86%), homelessness (58%), and tattooing (42%).

Methods: From October 2020 - September, 2021 we surveyed participants in San Diego, California and Tijuana, Mexico and employed Poisson regression to identify correlates of recent overdose. Results: Of 612 PWID, most were male (74.0 %), Latinx (71.9 %), US residents (67.0 %). Mean age was 43 years. In the last six months, 15.8 % experienced overdose, 31.0 % knowingly used fentanyl and 11.1 % used china white, of whom 77.9 % did not think it contained fentanyl. After controlling for sex and race, factors independently associated with risk of overdose included knowingly using fentanyl, using china white and not believing it contained fentanyl, recent drug rehabilitation, being stopped/arrested by police, and homelessness. Further, PWID who believed china white contained fentanyl were less likely to use it. Conclusions: Both intentional fentanyl use and unintentional exposure to fentanyl via china white were associated with overdose risk; however, PWID who believed china white contained fentanyl were less likely to use it. These data suggest that advanced drug checking systems should be implemented to empower PWID to avoid dangerous street formulations or to plan their drug use knowing its contents. Other overdose risk factors such as decreased tolerance following drug treatment, police interactions, and homelessness also require urgent intervention.","L2020400558     2022-10-03     2022-10-11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109644,diamorphine;fentanyl;adult;article;cohort analysis;controlled study;correlational study;drug dependence treatment;drug overdose;drug screening;drug tolerance;empowerment;female;health survey;Hispanic;homelessness;human;injection drug user;longitudinal study;major clinical study;male;Mexico;middle aged;opiate addiction;Poisson regression;police;race;resident;risk factor;sex;United States,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

By increasing the risk of isolation, fear, stigma, abuse and economic fallout, COVID-19 has led to increase in risk of psychiatric disorders, chronic trauma and stress, which eventually increase suicidality and suicidal behavior. There is limited data on association of pandemics and suicides. Cases of suicides have been rising since COVID-19 first emerged in China. The association between suicides and pandemics can possibly be explained through various models like Durkheim's theory, Joiner's interpersonal theory, social stress theory, biological theories, etc. The frontline workers, elderly, migrants, homeless, socio-economically impoverished classes as well as those with pre-existing mental disorders, substance abuse and family history of suicides are at higher risk. Suicides are preventable and need early detection, awareness and socio-culturally tailored interventions. This narrative review draws global perspectives on the association of suicidality and pandemics, the theories and risk factors related to same based on the available evidence. It also hypothesizes neuroimmunity and immune based risk factors as possible links between the psychosocial vulnerabilities and suicide during outbreaks like COVID-19.

Young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH)are at increased risk of NMUPD; however, community estimates of NMUPD among YEH are sparse. This current study sought to understand patterns and correlates of NMUPD in a geographically heterogeneous sample of YEH recruited from seven cities across the United States. Methods: From June 2016 to July 2017, 1,426 YEH (aged 18â€“26)were recruited from seven cities (Houston, Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix, New York City, St. Louis, San Jose). Participants provided information on substance use, mental health, trauma, and sexual-risk behaviors. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess demographic, psychological, and behavioral correlates of self-reported past-month NMUPD and NMUPD types (i.e., prescription stimulant, sedative, and opioids). Results: Approximately 20% of participants reported past-month NMUPD. Almost 9% reported misusing prescription opioids, 8.7% misused prescription sedatives, and 6% misused prescription stimulants. Multivariable logistic regressions revealed unmet mental health needs were associated with sedative and stimulant misuse but not opioid misuse. Having suicidal thoughts was associated with opioid misuse but not sedative or stimulant misuse. Although no geographical differences emerged for stimulant and sedative misuse, youth from Denver, Phoenix, and San Jose were more likely to engage in opioid misuse relative to youth in Los Angeles. Conclusions: These findings indicate that interventions designed to address NMUPD need to be multifaceted, designed to address other risk behaviors correlated with NMUPD, and target unmet mental health needs.","L2002014408     2019-05-29     2019-06-03 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.03.015,alprazolam;amphetamine plus dexamphetamine;buprenorphine;chlordiazepoxide;dexamphetamine;diazepam;fentanyl;flunitrazepam;hydrocodone;lorazepam;methadone;methylphenidate;oxazepam;oxycodone;adult;article;controlled study;cross-sectional study;demography;descriptive research;female;homelessness;human;injury;male;mental health;nonmedical use of prescription drug;Patient Health Questionnaire 9;prescription;prevalence;priority journal;self report;sexual behavior;substance use;suicidal ideation;suicide;United States;young adult;Drug Prescriptions;Prescriptions;Nonprescription Drugs;Prevalence;Prescription Drugs,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Particular attention was focused on the role of stimulants in opioid overdose deaths. Methods: We analyzed all opioid-related overdose deaths from 2014 to 2015 in an individually-linked population database in Massachusetts. We used linked postmortem toxicology data to identify drugs present at the time of death. We constructed a multinomial logistic regression model to identify factors associated with three mutually exclusive overdose death groups based on toxicological results: opioid-related deaths with (1)opioids only present, (2)opioids and other substances not including stimulants, and (3)opioids and stimulants with or without other substances. Results: Between 2014 and 2015, there were 2,244 opioid-related overdose deaths in Massachusetts that had accompanying toxicology results. Toxicology reports indicated that 17% had opioids only, 36% had opioids plus stimulants, and 46% had opioids plus another non-stimulant substance. Persons older than 24 years, non-rural residents, those with comorbid mental illness, non-Hispanic black residents, and persons with recent homelessness were more likely than their counterparts to die with opioids and stimulants than opioids alone. Conclusions: Polysubstance opioid overdose is increasingly common in the US. Addressing modifiable social determinants of health, including barriers to mental health services and homelessness, is important to reduce polysubstance use and overdose deaths.","L2001956401     2019-05-17     2019-05-28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.03.014,alcohol;amphetamine;benzodiazepine derivative;cannabis;clonidine;cocaine;codeine;diamorphine;fentanyl;gabapentin;hydrocodone;hydromorphone;morphine;opiate;oxycodone;oxymorphone;tramadol;adolescent;adult;article;cause of death;child;comorbidity;controlled study;demography;drug fatality;female;health disparity;homelessness;human;human cell;ICD-10;major clinical study;male;Massachusetts;mental health service;prescription;priority journal;risk factor;social determinants of health,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Awdeh, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland","Homelessness is a complex phenomenon consisting of many dimensions, which are difficult to capture in official figures. From a dermatological prospective, presentations are diverse, but they most commonly include a high rate of cutaneous infection. Homeless people face a number of barriers in the management of skin disease. The aim of this project is provide an insight into our experience of managing more complex presentations in the context of the many difficulties associated with being homeless. Themes include compliance, accessibility and managing patients' comorbidities. We highlight compliance as one of the most difficult barriers in accessing highquality patient care. Due to the lack of a permanent address, and often a telephone number, patients struggled to attend appointments as scheduled. In relation to a patient with severe chronic plaque psoriasis, our motivation when choosing a biological agent was influenced by his social circumstances. Challenges including a chaotic lifestyle and active substance misuse were mitigated by involving his general practitioner and arranging regular, supported injections in the community. Ustekinumab was commenced owing to its favourable dosing regimen. Managing a patient with acne conglobate with oral isotretinoin in a background of mood disturbances was another problem due to difficulty linking the patient with other services and frequent cancellations. We ameliorate this by sending text messages around the visit time. Another issue is accessibility to healthcare. We had a young patient with malignant melanoma in situ with multiple pigmented lesions that needed recurrent follow-up. She had a 2-month delay in arranging a positron emission tomography scan due to lack of access. Unfortunately she was then found to have metastatic melanoma. Managing a patient with hidradenitis suppurativa, acne and basal cell carcinoma on a background history of alcoholic liver disease was another issue. Since receiving housing he has been able to access better healthcare. We highlight these barriers in order to emphasize the difficulties this patient population experiences when trying to access dermatological care. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that describes the difficulties faced by the homeless population in the management of their skin conditions.","L628867493     2019-08-14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Conference Abstract,Physical health condition - Dermatology",10.1111/bjd.17907,biological product;isotretinoin;ustekinumab;acne vulgaris;adult;alcohol liver disease;basal cell carcinoma;cancer patient;cancer recurrence;comorbidity;conference abstract;dermatology;drug therapy;female;follow up;general practitioner;housing;human;injection;lifestyle;male;metastatic melanoma;mood disorder;motivation;patient care;positron emission tomography;psoriasis vulgaris;skin infection;suppurative hidradenitis;telephone,,,Y,N,Included

The study aim was to estimate the incidence of self-harm among the homeless population and to assess factors associated with self-harm. METHODS: Data on self-harm presentations to 34 hospital emergency departments in Ireland were collected by the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland (NSHRI). Index presentations between 2010 and 2014 were included for the homeless and fixed residence populations. Incidence rates of self-harm were calculated using NSHRI data and census estimates. Factors associated with self-harm and repeated self-harm were analysed by multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: The age-standardised incidence rate of self-harm was 30 times higher among the homeless (5572 presentations per 100,000) compared with those with a fixed residence (187 presentations per 100,000). Homeless people had significantly higher odds of being male (OR 1.86, 95%CI 1.56-2.23), presenting with self-cutting (vs. overdose, OR 2.15, 95%CI 1.74-2.66) and having psychiatric admission (vs. general admission, OR 2.43, 95%CI 1.66-3.57). Homeless people had higher odds of self-harm repetition within 12 months (vs. fixed residence, OR 1.46, 95%CI 1.21-1.77). The odds of repetition were significantly increased among homeless who engaged in self-cutting (vs. overdose, OR 1.76, 95%CI 1.17-2.65) and did not receive psychiatric review at index presentation (vs. reviewed, OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.05-2.26). LIMITATIONS: The study only reflects self-harm presenting to hospital, and assumes no change in homelessness status after index presentation. Residual confounding may affect the results. CONCLUSION: There is a disproportionate burden of self-harm among the homeless. Targeted preventive actions are warranted.","1573-2517     Barrett, Peter     Griffin, Eve     Corcoran, Paul     O'Mahony, Mary T     Arensman, Ella     Journal Article     Netherlands     J Affect Disord. 2018 Mar 15;229:523-531. doi: 10.1016/j.jad.2017.12.040.

One of the major barriers to effecting EU- and WHO-mandated HCV elimination by 2030 is underdiagnosis. Community-based screening strategies have been identified as important components of HCV models of care. HepCheck Europe is a large-scale intensified screening initiative aimed at enhancing identification of HCV infection among vulnerable populations and linkage to care. METHODS: Research teams across four European countries were engaged in the study and rolled out screening to high-risk populations in community addiction, homeless and prison services. Screening was offered to 2822 individuals and included a self-administered questionnaire, HCV antibody and RNA testing, liver fibrosis assessment and referral to specialist services. RESULTS: There was a 74% (n=2079) uptake of screening. The majority (85.8%, n=1783) were male. In total 44.6% (n=927) of the sample reported ever injecting drugs, 38.4% (n=799) reported ever being homeless and 27.9% (n=581) were prisoners. In total 397 (19%) active HCV infections were identified and 136 (7% of total sample and 34% of identified active infections) were new cases. Of those identified with active HCV infection, 80% were linked to care, which included liver fibrosis assessment and referral to specialist services. CONCLUSIONS: HepCheck's screening and linkage to care is a clear strategy for reaching high-risk populations, including those at highest risk of transmission who are not accessing any type of care in the community. Elimination of HCV in the EU will only be achieved by such innovative, patient-centred approaches.","1460-2091     Barror, Suzanne     Avramovic, Gordana     Oprea, Cristiana     Surey, Julian     Story, Alistair     MacÃ­as, Juan     Cullen, Walter     Crowley, Des     Horan, Aidan     Naughton, Anna Marie     Iglesias, Maria     Ianache, Irina     Lazar, Stefan     Popa, Ionut     McHugh, Tina     Menezes, Dee     Tinago, Willard     Lambert, John S     Journal Article     Multicenter Study     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     J Antimicrob Chemother. 2019 Nov 1;74(Suppl 5):v39-v46. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkz455. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Infectious Diseases - Hep/HCV",10.1093/jac/dkz455,Adult;Delivery of Health Care/*methods;Drug Users/statistics & numerical data;Europe/epidemiology;Feasibility Studies;Female;Hepatitis C/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology;Hepatitis C Antibodies/blood;Homeless Persons/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Male;Mass Screening/*methods;Middle Aged;Prisoners/statistics & numerical data;Prospective Studies;Social Marginalization;Europe,,,Y,N,Included

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A systematic review methodology was used to identify quantitative observational studies that looked at the prevalence of homelessness at the time of imprisonment, or up to 30 days prior to that point (initial homelessness), and at the time of discharge from prisons. Studies reported in English from inception to 11 September 2019 were searched for using eight databases (PsycInfo, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycArticles, Scopus, Web of Science and the Campbell Collaboration), in addition to grey literature. Studies were screened independently by three researchers. Results of studies meeting inclusion criteria were meta-analysed using a random effects model to generate pooled prevalence data. FINDINGS: A total of 18 out of 2,131 studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies originated from the USA, Canada, UK, Ireland or Australia. The estimated prevalence of initial homelessness was 23.41% and at time of discharge was 29.94%. Substantial heterogeneity was observed among studies. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: People in prisons are over twenty times more likely to be homeless than those in the general population. This is likely attributable to a range of health and social factors. Studies in this analysis suggest higher rates of homelessness in minority populations and among those with mental illnesses and neurodevelopmental disorders. While there was significant heterogeneity among studies, the results highlight the global burden of this issue and a clear necessity for targeted interventions to address homelessness in this population.","1744-9219     Bashir, Ahmad Y     Moloney, Noreen     Elzain, Musaab E     Delaunois, Isabelle     Sheikhi, Ali     O'Donnell, Patrick     Dunne, Colum P     Kelly, Brendan D     Gulati, Gautam     Journal Article     Meta-Analysis     Review     Systematic Review     England     Int J Prison Health. 2021 Jun 11;ahead-of-print(ahead-of-print). doi: 10.1108/IJPH-01-2021-0010. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1108/ijph-01-2021-0010,Australia;*Homeless Persons;Humans;*Mental Disorders/epidemiology;Prevalence;Prisons;Homelessness;Incarceration;Jail;Oecd;Prison,,,N,N,Full text screen

Baxter, College of Medicinal,Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom","Background Access to housing is an important determinant of health, with homeless people having substantially increased morbidity and mortality compared to the housed population. Conventional 'Treatment First' (TF) models for tackling homelessness provide temporary accommodation conditional on adherence to services to address health needs, particularly substance use. A new policy approach aiming to end homelessness across Europe and North America, the 'Housing First' (HF) model, provides rapid housing, not conditional on abstinence from substance use. This has been noted by other reviewers as improving housing stability, but at the potential cost of removing incentives to use health services and abstain from harmful substances. Conversely, increased housing stability may lead to health improvements. We aimed to systematically review the evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of HF on health and well-being. Method We searched seven databases for randomised controlled trials of interventions providing rapid access to nonabstinence- contingent, permanent housing. We extracted data for the following primary outcomes: mental health; selfreported health and quality of life; substance use; non-routine use of healthcare services. Data recording housing stability was extracted as a secondary outcome. We assessed risk of bias and calculated standardised effect sizes. Results We included four studies, all with 'high' risk of bias. The impact of HF on most short-term health outcomes was imprecisely estimated, with varying effect directions. No clear difference in substance use was seen. Intervention groups experienced fewer emergency department visits (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=0.63; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82), fewer hospitalisations (IRR=0.76; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.83) and less time spent hospitalised (standardised mean difference (SMD)=-0.14; 95% CI -0.41 to 0.14) than control groups. In all studies intervention participants spent more days housed (SMD=1.24; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.62) and were more likely to be housed at 18-24 months (risk ratio=2.46; 95% CI 1.58 to 3.84). Conclusion HF approaches successfully improve housing stability and may improve some aspects of health. Implementation of HF would likely reduce homelessness and non-routine health service use without an increase in problematic substance use. Impacts on long-term health outcomes require further investigation.","L638508502     2022-07-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1136/jech-2019-SSMabstracts.140,adult;conference abstract;controlled study;effect size;emergency ward;female;health care utilization;homelessness;hospitalization;housing;human;human experiment;incentive;incidence;male;mental health;meta analysis;outcome assessment;quality of life;randomized controlled trial (topic);risk assessment;substance use;systematic review;wellbeing,,,N,N,Full text screen

Bennett, National Development and Research Institutes, New York City, NY, United States","Aims: To better understand overdose risks it is important to investigate the time period preceding overdose events (PPOEs). Methods: As part of an ongoing mixed-methods cohort study, we used venue-based and chain referral methods to recruit opioidusing veterans in New York City during 2014-2015. We used qualitative interviews to develop 11 questions regarding overdose risk behaviors during the PPOEs. In monthly follow-up assessments we asked about any overdose events participants perceived that they experienced, and asked about overdose risk behaviors during the period preceding their most severe overdose event. Results: Among 213 primarily minority and low-income veterans with an average age of 37 (SD = 10.5) 67 reported at least one overdose event during any 30-day follow-up period. These 67 participants reported on 110 overdose events (mean = 1.7, SD = 1.4) during an average follow-up of 4 months (SD = 3.5). In the 48 hours preceding their most severe overdose event 59% used prescription opioids; of those, 69% used more than their usual amount; 29% used heroin; of those, 79% used more than their usual amount; 65% drank any alcohol; of those, 75% had 5 or more drinks; 31% used stimulant drugs; 36% used benzodiazepines; 34% used sleep medication; a total of 80% used multiple drugs. In the 5 days preceding overdose events 39% abstained or used fewer opioids than usual. Qualitative interviews indicated that relationships, unstable housing, unemployment, and denial of benefits often precipitated increased substance use patterns during the PPOE. Conclusions: Known drug and alcohol-related risk behaviors, such as dose escalation, poly-drug use and use after a period of abstinence, are common preceding overdose events of veterans. Qualitative insights suggest that interventions should focus on these behaviors in the context of the complex physical, psychological and social challenges veterans face.","L618520786     2017-10-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.065,alcohol;benzodiazepine derivative;central stimulant agent;diamorphine;abstinence;adult;cohort analysis;drug combination;drug overdose;female;follow up;housing;human;interview;lowest income group;major clinical study;male;multiple drug abuse;New York;patient referral;prescription;sleep;substance use;unemployment;veteran;Risk-Taking;Veterans,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Overdose prevention and management strategies should be a key concern for settings that provide services to drug users and in particular to opioid injectors. The service user perspective is an important consideration in overdose prevention and management. Aim: To examine the experience of drug overdose among service users at a single addiction clinic, and thus inform future overdose prevention and management strategies. Methods: An anonymous census of all service users at a single urban addiction clinic was conducted in order to establish the experience of personal or witnessed drug overdose within the preceding year. Following this census, questionnaire-based interviews were conducted to examine the service user experience of drug overdose in greater detail. Results: A census response rate of 96% (216) was achieved. Eighteen service users participated in a follow up questionnaire-based interview. Almost one-third of service users (31%) had either witnessed or personally experienced an overdose in the previous year. A quarter of the population (25%) had witnessed but not experienced an overdose. Service users who were interviewed, were willing to intervene in overdose situations but many were unaware of the opiate antidote naloxone. Conclusions: A significant proportion of service users at this single clinic had recent experience of drug overdose. Overdose prevention and management strategies are relevant to this population.

The sample included 821 men hospitalized at an inpatient Addiction unit (305 alcohol users, 233 cocaine/crack users, and 283 multiusers). Data were collected using the Addiction Severity Index version 6. The most prevalent risk factors for COVID-19 severity observed in our sample were: smoking (82.5%), arterial hypertension (26.6%), respiratory problems (23.4%), and history of homelessness (25.1%). Arterial hypertension and cirrhosis occurred more frequently among alcohol users. Multiusers lived in the streets longer and had a higher prevalence of HIV than alcohol users. Overall, 28% of the sample had three or more risk factors. The frequency of risk factors was high and this scenario suggests that these individuals could be more susceptible to worse COVID-19 prognosis. Therefore, prevention strategies directed at specific characteristics of substance users merit attention during the pandemic.","L2011612864     2021-04-13     2021-05-13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113915,Addiction Severity Index;adult;alcohol consumption;alcoholism;article;cocaine dependence;coronavirus disease 2019;disease severity;homelessness;human;hypertension;liver cirrhosis;major clinical study;male;morbidity;mortality rate;population research;prevalence;priority journal;prognosis;respiratory tract disease;risk factor;smoking;substance use;Alcoholics,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Bharat, National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia","Background: Longer retention in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is associated with improved treatment outcomes but 12-month retention rates are often low. Innovative approaches are needed to strengthen retention in OAT. We develop and compare traditional and deep learning-extensions of Cox regression to examine the potential for predicting time in OAT at individualsâ€™ first episode entry. Methods: Retrospective cohort study in New South Wales, Australia including 16,576 people entering OAT for the first time between January 2006 and December 2017. We develop 12-month OAT cessation prediction models using traditional and deep learning-extensions of the Cox regression algorithm with predictors evaluated from linked administrative datasets. Proportion of explained variation, calibration, and discrimination are compared using 5 Ã— 2 cross-validation. Results: Twelve-month cessation rate was 58.4%. The largest hazard ratios for earlier cessation from the deep learning model were observed for treatment factors, including private dosing points (HR=1.54, 95% CI=1.49â€“1.60) and buprenorphine medication (HR=1.43, 95% CI=1.39â€“1.46). Diagnostic codes for homelessness (HR=1.09, 95% CI=1.04â€“1.13), outpatient treatment for drug use disorders (HR=1.10, 95% CI=1.06â€“1.15), and occupant of vehicle accident (HR=1.04, 95% CI=1.01â€“1.07) from past-year health service presentations were identified as significant predictors of retention. We observed no improvement in performance of the deep learning model over traditional Cox regression. Conclusions: Deep learning may be more useful in identifying novel risk factors of OAT retention from administrative data than evaluating individual-level risk. An increased focus on addressing structural issues at the population level and considering alternate models of care may be more effective at improving retention than delivering fully personalised OAT.","L2014776983     2021-11-15     2022-02-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109091,"buprenorphine;methadone;adult;article;Australia;calibration;cohort analysis;deep learning;drug effect;female;hazard ratio;human;major clinical study;male;opiate addiction;prediction;retrospective study;risk assessment;survival analysis;treatment outcome;treatment planning;trend study;Analgesics, Opioid",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Bishop, VA VISN 2 Center of Excellence for Suicide Prevention, Canandaigua, NY, United States","Aims: This review examined the literature on the relationship between cocaine use and high-risk sexual behavior among individuals diagnosed with a severe mental illness (SMI). Methods: A literature search was conducted using the PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES databases. Articles were included if they reported sexual risk (vaginal or anal sex without a condom), cocaine use, were peer-reviewed, written in English, and included participants diagnosed with SMI (schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or bipolar disorder). Results: The 8 articles that met criteria had a mean sample size of 122. Participants were predominantly male (63%), outpatients (7/8 articles), and had a history of homelessness (71%). Cocaine use was typically reported as either frequency of use or presence of a cocaine use disorder. Three studies collapsed condom use into a sexual risk composite variable. Cocaine use was collapsed into a general substance use variable in 4/8 articles. Studies that collapsed cocaine use into a composite variable consistently found that substance use was associated with elevated rates of high-risk sex. In contrast, 67% of studies that did not use composite variables for either cocaine or condom use showed that cocaine was unrelated to likelihood of high-risk sex. Conclusions: The direct relationship between illicit drug use and risky sexual behavior observed in other populations appears to also occur among those with a SMI. However, methodological limitations of the literature, particularly retrospective, global association study design and proclivity for using composite variables, preclude stronger conclusions regarding the relationship between cocaine and high-risk sexual behavior.","L72176442     2016-02-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.07.973,cocaine;illicit drug;risk;mental disease;narrative;college;drug dependence;unsafe sex;human;condom use;substance use;outpatient;sample size;bipolar disorder;schizophrenia;homelessness;study design;population;sexual behavior;drug use;male;condom;data base;diseases;PsycINFO;Cocaine;Mentally Ill Persons,,,N,N,Full text screen

This study aims to compare the costs per person screened, diagnosed/identified, and linked to care for various pilot interventions undertaken as part of the HepCare Europe programme. Method: Four interventions were costed: 1. Nurse liaison for GP prescribers of OST in Dublin (HepLink Dublin); 2. Nurse led mobile outreach in London targeting homeless populations and people who inject drugs, with peer support for linkage to HCV treatment in hospital (HepFriend London); 3. Mass opt-out screening in a Dublin prison with a peer based awareness program (HepCheck Dublin); and 4. Screening and linkage to care in targeted high-risk settings in Bucharest (HepCare Bucharest). For each site, intervention costs were collected by interview with intervention staff using a top down approach, including staff costs, resource use and HCV test costs. Setup costs were annualised over 5 years. The cost (in â‚¬) per person screened, diagnosed and linked to care was calculated for each intervention. Costs and patients screened, diagnosed, and linked to care for HepFriend London were taken from the middle year of the intervention. Results: The costs per year were â‚¬64,806, â‚¬112,093, â‚¬81,505, and â‚¬56,647 for HepLink Dublin, HepFriend London, HepCheck Dublin, and HepCare Bucharest, respectively. The cost per patient outcome were impacted by the size of the target population reached and the prevalence of HCV in each setting. The HepFriend London intervention also had a peer support component helping patients to attend hospital appointments and adhere to treatment which cost an additional â‚¬775 per patient treated (n = 44). [Table presented] Conclusion: Within HepCare Europe, the unit costs per person differed by 6-fold between the highest (HepLink Dublin) and lowest (HepCare Bucharest) cost interventions. This highlights that the implementation of similar interventions in different settings within Europe can have very different costs. A crucial next step will be to evaluate the impact of these interventions on patient outcomes.","L2007845422     2021-02-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong topic (cost of care)",10.1016/S0168-8278(20)32092-4,adult;awareness;conference abstract;controlled study;England;female;Hepatitis C virus;human;injection drug user;interview;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;nurse;peer group;prevalence;correctional facility;Europe,,,N,N,Full text screen

Characteristics of drug users may be associated with the number of overdoses ever witnessed. This information could inform overdose prevention programs. Methods: Participants in New York City, who were age 18 and older with heroin and/or cocaine use in the past two months, were administered structured interviews (n = 1184). Survey topics included overdose response, drug use behavior, treatment history, and demographic information. Results: In a multivariable negative binomial regression model, those persons who were male (IRR [Incidence Rate Ratio] = 1.7, Cl [95% Confidence Interval] = 1.4,2.2), had experienced homelessness (IRR = 1.9, CI =1.4,2.6), had used heroin (IRR = 2.0, CI = 1.3,3.2), had overdosed themselves (IRR = 1.9, CI = 1.6,2.4), or had attended Narcotics Anonymous (IRR = 1.3, Cl = 1.1,1.6) witnessed a greater count of overdoses in their lifetime. Those persons who have witnessed more overdoses were less likely to have sought medical assistance (OR [Odds Ratio] = 0.7) and more likely to report counter-productive or ineffective actions (ORs between 1.9 and 2.4) at the last overdose they witnessed compared to persons who had only ever witnessed one or two overdoses. Conclusions: Persons at high risk for overdose are likely to witness more overdoses. Persons who had witnessed more overdoses were more likely to report taking ineffective action at the last overdose witnessed. Individuals who have witnessed many overdoses are likely key targets of overdose response training.

The aim of this study was to understand the process for individuals as they transitioned from services to sustained tenancies from an occupational science perspective. A constructivist grounded theory study was conducted with people who had experienced multiple exclusion homelessness. Interviews using reflexive photography were carried out with individuals (Nâ€‰=â€‰29) from three cities in the UK and Ireland. â€˜Making a homeâ€™ was the core process identified in tenancy sustainment. It highlighted the significance of everyday activities and routines in enabling participants to personalise the tenancy, develop their identity as tenants, and maintain daily routines and roles to support it. An occupational perspective can enhance understanding of tenancy sustainment following homelessness.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional personal network (egocentric) and geographic study of young PWID and their drug-using, sexual, and support network members in 2012-13 in metropolitan Chicago, Illinois, U.S. Results: We enrolled 164 young (median age = 26), mostly male (65%), non-Hispanic white PWID (71%), with a self-reported HCV prevalence of 13%. Many (59%) reported multiple residences (i.e., were transient) in the past year, 45% of whom reported living in both urban and suburban places (i.e., were cross-over transients). In multivariable analyses that adjusted for participant and network member characteristics, (1) large injection networks were more common among homeless participants; and (2) syringe sharing was (a) highest among cross-over transients compared to suburban (OR= 4.19 95% CI 1.69-10.35) and urban only residents (OR= 2.91 95% CI 1.06-8.03), (b) higher among HCV-unknown compared HCV-negative participants (OR= 4.62 95% CI 1.69-10.35), (c) more likely with network members who were cross-over transients compared to urban (OR =4.94, 95% CI 2.17-11.23) and (d) less likely with network members with HCV-unknown compared to HCV-negative status (OR= 0.4 95% CI 0.19-0.84). Conclusions: We identified homelessness as a significant risk factor for large networks and cross-over transience as a significant risk factor for syringe sharing.

Bourke, Temple Street Children's University Hospital, Ireland","Introduction: An 8-year-old girl presented to Temple Street Children's Hospital on 19/11/18 for a review appointment for left neurotrophic ulcer in a non-seeing eye. She has a background history of Neurofibromatosis type 2, left optic nerve meningioma and left corneal denervation. Case description: The patient developed a Stage 2 neurotrophic ulcer in her left eye in July 2018. This was being treated with Dexamethasone drops and ocular lubricants. She went on holidays in November 2018 and was swimming in the hotel pool. One day later her left eye became increasingly red. On return from holidays she attended Temple Street. Initial examination revealed hypopyon with an inferior corneal infiltrate 5mm x 2mm. She was admitted to hospital for hourly vancomycin and ceftazidime drops to left eye and oral Ciprofloxacin. The hypopyon slowly reduced in size over coming days. She received 7 days of intensive topical antibiotics and underwent a lateral tarsorrhaphy. She was discharged home on Prednisolone minims, Vitapos, Hyloforte and Chloramphenicol ointment. At her outpatient review one week later, Actrapid insulin in Systane 1 unit/ml eye drops were commenced three times daily in her left eye. The lateral tarsorrhaphy spontaneously opened one month later. The patients mother is very keen to avoid another one as it disfigures her. She already likes to wear glasses to try and hide her left eye. Over the following weeks this lead to a drastic improvement in her left corneal ulcer with the corneal epithelial defect decreasing in size. Discussion: Insulin is a widely available, safe and effective medication that has been shown to improve corneal re-epithelialisation in vitro and in diabetic animal models. In diabetic mice, topical insulin has been shown to slow the loss of sub-basal plexus corneal nerves. A recent study in the United States has demonstrated the efficacy of insulin drops. This study involved six patients with neurotrophic corneal ulcers that were refractory to a range of medical and surgical treatments. Each patient was started on topical insulin drops with complete corneal re-epithelialization within 7 to 25 days. Further studies are needed on this novel treatment This is the first documented case of this use of insulin in paediatric ophthalmology care in Ireland.","L628101567     2019-06-19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s11845-019-02025-4,artificial tear;ceftazidime;chloramphenicol;ciprofloxacin;dexamethasone;eye drops;insulin;prednisolone;vancomycin;animal experiment;animal model;conference abstract;cornea ulcer;denervation;diabetes mellitus;drug combination;drug resistance;drug therapy;epithelization;female;girl;homeless youth;in vitro study;Ireland;meningioma;mouse;neurofibromatosis type 2;nonhuman;ointment;ophthalmology;optic nerve;outpatient;skin defect;spectacles;swimming;topical drug administration;United States;Insulin;Insulins,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

With continued research, policy advocacy, and innovative service programming, it is possible to move toward a future in which homelessness is prevented or minimized and good health is maximized for all people. This chapter describes the range of health disparities experienced by people who are homeless, including disparities regarding a variety of conditions, such as serious mental illness, addiction, infectious diseases, and food insecurity. It also reviews the concept of multi-morbidity. The chapter discusses the pathways or conditions that explain why homeless people experience health disparities, drawing on relevant research and theory.

DESIGN: The study used a qualitative descriptive design, combining semi-structured interviews with a standardized quantitative measure of food insecurity. Interview data were coded using constant comparative methods to identify patterns across and within interviews. Emerging themes were confirmed and refined through member checking. SETTING: Buffalo, a mid-sized city in the Northeastern USA. SUBJECTS: A sample of thirty participants was recruited through community-based methods. Eligibility criteria specified that participants were aged 18-24 years and did not have a stable place to live.

Data on homeless veterans with severe mental illness (SMI) were provided by the Northeast Program Evaluation Center (NEPEC) Special Needs-Chronic Mental Illness (SN-CMI) study (Kasprow and Rosenheck, 2008). The study used the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale to measure internalized stigma at baseline and the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) to measure depressive and psychotic symptoms at baseline and 3 and 6 month follow-ups. Higher levels of internalized stigma were associated with greater levels of depressive and psychotic symptoms 3 and 6 months later, even controlling for symptoms at baseline. Alienation and Discrimination Experience were the subscales most strongly associated with symptoms. Exploratory analyses of individual items yielded further insight into characteristics of potentially successful interventions that could be studied. Overall, our findings show that homeless veterans with SMI experiencing higher levels of internalized stigma are likely to experience more depression and psychosis over time.

Since the introduction of the UK Health and Safety Executive's Management Standards (MS) in 2004, a number of studies have been undertaken to assess the potential adaptation of the MS framework within Ireland. AIMS: To investigate the dimensionality, reliability and validity of the Irish version of the MS Indicator Tool (ROI-MSIT). METHODS: Between February 2011 and June 2014, we collected data from a wide range of public and private sector organizations that used the ROI-MSIT. In addition to the ROI-MSIT, respondents completed the WHO-Five Well-being Index (WHO-5). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to determine whether the ROI-MSIT maintained the structure of the UK instrument. The internal consistency of the ROI-MSIT was also assessed to determine its reliability, while its criterion-related validity was explored through correlation analysis with the WHO-5. RESULTS: Data were collected from 7377 participants. The factor structure of the ROI-MSIT consisted of six factors; the Demands, Control, Peer Support, Relationships and Role factors were equivalent to the original UK factors. Like the Italian version, a principal factor emerged that combined the Manager Support and Change domains. Cronbach's alpha scores ranged from 0.75 to 0.91. Finally, the ROI-MSIT's subscales and WHO-5 were positively correlated (r = 0.42-0.59, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The ROI-MSIT is reliable and valid, with a factor structure similar to the original UK instrument and the Italian MSIT.

Bozinoff, BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Aims: Syringe sharing is a risky practice that is associated with the transmission of hepatitis C and HIV. This study examines the prevalence and correlates of syringe sharing within a prospective cohort of street-involved youth in a Canadian city with wellestablished harm reduction programs. Methods: From September, 2005 to May, 2014, data were collected from the At-Risk Youth Study, a NIDA-funded cohort of street-involved youth age 14-26 and analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Results: Among 505 street-involved youth who use injection drugs, 241 (47.7%) reported sharing a syringe at some point during the study period. In multivariable analysis, factors positively associated with syringe sharing in the past six months included: homelessness (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.44, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.08-1.93), difficulty finding needles (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.14-2.04), attempting and being unable to access addiction treatment (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.05-2.15), sex work (AOR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.17-2.38), and binging on drugs (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.19-2.00). Having accessed any healthcare was protective for syringe sharing (AOR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53-0.98). Conclusions: The cumulative prevalence of syringe sharing among street-involved youth in this setting was high and independently associated with a number of structural barriers including difficulty accessing clean needles, difficulty accessing addiction treatment, and homelessness. Conversely, accessing health services was protective for syringe sharing. Findings underscore the influence of structural factors in shaping the risk environment for vulnerable youth.","L618520083     2017-10-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.082,addiction;binge eating disorder;Canada;cohort analysis;harm reduction;homelessness;human;juvenile;needle sharing;prevalence;prospective study;risk assessment;Adolescent;Syringes;Needle Sharing,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Bramness, Norwegian Centre for Addiction Research, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Aims: The aim of this prospective study was to investigate which risk factors mediate the risk of hospitalization due to psychosis in a cohort of amphetamine users in the Swedish criminal justice system. Methods: Amphetamine-using prison inmates or clients of other correctional facilities in Sweden were identified using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) interview. Between 2001 and 2006, a total of 1709 individuals were identified. A follow-up of the subjects, using national registry data, was conducted in 2010. The outcome measure was hospitalization for primary or substance induced psychotic episodes during the follow-up period. Data were analyzed in a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Age of onset of amphetamine use, number of years used, and use in the month prior to baseline interview were all unrelated to risk of future hospitalization due to psychosis. Prior psychiatric hospitalization and experience of hallucinations not related to drug use, as well as being born outside of a Nordic country or being homeless, were all positively linked to hospitalization due to psychosis. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that, in a cohort of amphetamine users within the criminal justice system, prior psychiatric morbidity and demographic risk factors are more important than baseline patterns of amphetamine use in predicting future risk of hospitalization due to psychosis. These findings suggest the need for a more integrated understanding of amphetamine use and psychosis.","L71802521     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.091,amphetamine;human;criminal justice;drug dependence;prospective study;college;psychosis;risk factor;hospitalization;risk;interview;correctional facility;follow up;drug use;hallucination;onset age;model;logistic regression analysis;Addiction Severity Index;morbidity;register;Sweden;Risk Factors;Dextroamphetamine;Amphetamine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Brannick, Temple Street Children's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland","Aims: The neonatal service of Temple Street Children's University Hospital (TSCUH) includes St. Michael's B ward (SMB; 8 beds) and the HDU (6 beds). Admissions to the HDU are restricted to transfers from maternity hospitals (Brennan & Murphy, 2018). The new children's hospital (NCH) will establish a single entity to integrate the services currently provided by TSCUH, OLCHC, and the NCH Tallaght (Department of Health, 2017). The aim of this study is to produce qualitative analysis of the patient population/resource use in the neonatal HDU/SMB in order to plan for delivery of care in the NCH. Methods: Using the nursing admissions books, data was retrospectively collected for 6 months of admissions (July to December 2017). Results: In the HDU (N=59), 15% of patients had a CGA of <37/40. The median age was 5 days; the median LOS was 8 days (range: 1-125 days). 71% of patients were jointly admitted by Neonatology/surgical specialty. The most common diagnoses were myelomeningocoele (14%) and TOF (12%). 19% of patients required NIV; 27% received TPN. In SMB (N=279), 2% of patients had a CGA of <37/40. The median age was 6 weeks; the median LOS was 2 days (range: 1-22 days). 71% of patients were admitted under the care of General Paediatrics. The most common diagnosis was bronchiolitis (22%) with a clear seasonal trend observed. 9% of patients required NIV. Conclusion: The neonatal ward in TSCUH offers a unique service, allowing access to specialist care that is not available in the maternity hospitals, and providing a high level of support to term/premature newborns. It is clear that a specialised neonatal ward is necessary to safely care for this patient population, along with separation from the significant burden of infection that is present on high-turnover general wards.

This study examined the prevalence, frequency, and predictors of illicit OSD use in a group of injecting drug users (IDUs) and assessed if such use was associated with non-fatal overdoses. Methods: Semi-annual cross-sectional interviews conducted in Oslo, Norway (2006-2013), from 1355 street-recruited IDUs. Hurdle, logistic, and multinomial regression models were employed. Results: Overall, 27% reported illicit OSD use in the past four weeks; 16.8% methadone, 12.5% buprenorphine, and 2.9% both drugs. Almost 1/10 reported at least one non-fatal overdose in the past four weeks, and roughly 1/3 reported such experience in the past year. Use of additional drugs tended to be equally, or more prevalent among illicit OSD users than other IDUs. In terms of illicit OSD use being a risk factor for non-lethal overdoses, our results showed significant associations only for infrequent buprenorphine use (using once or less than once per week). Other factors associated with non-fatal overdoses included age, education, homelessness, as well as the benzodiazepines, stimulants, and heroin use. Conclusions: Users of diverted OSD may represent a high-risk population, as they used more additional drugs and used them more frequently than other IDUs. However, illicit OSD use may be less harmful than previously assumed. After accounting for an extensive set of covariates, only infrequent illicit buprenorphine use, but not methadone use, was associated with non-fatal overdoses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Clinical presentation: The first case is a 2 year old girl that presented to the emergency department with a 3 week history of a parotid swelling and was promptly referred to ENT. An MRI scan revealed multiple lesions in her mandible and zygomatic arch, after which a CT scan located the primary lesion in her abdomen, and a clinical diagnosis of neuroblastoma was made. The second case presented to ophthalmology with visual loss and proptosis. After a large symmetrical anterior skull base tumour was found on MRI invading the sinuses, neurosurgery approached ENT with a view of performing a transnasal biopsy. Management: Both cases show the importance of interdisciplinary communication. The first combined ENT, general medicine, and oncology to diagnose and treat the patient. The second, while initially presenting as an ophthalmology case, required ENT, neurosurgery and oncology to diagnose and manage her condition. Conclusion: The MDT approach to the paediatric oncology patient is imperative as occasionally other specialty input is required to provide prompt high quality patient care, ultimately treating the patient holistically.","L614674139     2017-03-09 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1007/s11845-016-1499-2,abdomen;blindness;case report;child;childhood cancer;diagnosis;emergency ward;exophthalmos;female;general practice;girl;homeless youth;human;human tissue;interdisciplinary communication;mandible;nasal biopsy;neuroblastoma;neurosurgery;nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;ophthalmology;parotid gland;patient care;preschool child;skull base tumor;swelling;x-ray computed tomography,,,N,N,Full text screen

Reflective of overall health and factors such as acquired injuries, physical ability or functioning is often low among people who are homeless, but there is a lack of consistency of measures used to evaluate this construct. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a broad test battery to evaluate limitations in physical functioning among people who are homeless. METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational study occurred in a hospital in Dublin, Ireland. We evaluated lower extremity physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery), falls risk (timed up and go), functional capacity (six-minute walk test), stair-climbing ability (stair climb test), frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale), grip strength (handgrip dynamometer) and muscular mass (calf circumference measurement) in a population of people experiencing homelessness admitted for acute medical care. The test completion rate was evaluated for feasibility. RESULTS: The completion rate varied: 65% (Short Physical Performance Battery), 55.4% (timed up and go), 38% (six-minute walk test), 31% (stair climb test), 97% (Clinical Frailty Scale), 75% (handgrip dynamometer), 74% (calf circumference measurement)). Collectively, the most common reasons for test non-participation were pain (24.1%, n = 40), not feeling well or able enough (20.1%, n = 33), and declined (11%, n = 18). CONCLUSION: The feasibility of the test battery was mixed as test participation rates varied from 31% to 97%. Physical functioning tests need to be carefully chosen for people who are homeless as many standard tests are unsuitable due to pain and poor physical ability.","1660-4601     Broderick, Julie     Orcid: 0000-0002-2572-6479     Kiernan, Sinead     Murphy, Niamh     Dowds, Joanne     NÃ­ Cheallaigh, Cliona     Orcid: 0000-0002-0842-425x     Journal Article     Observational Study     Switzerland     Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 Jan 25;18(3):1035. doi: 10.3390/ijerph18031035. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Wrong topic (tool evaluation)",10.3390/ijerph18031035,Cross-Sectional Studies;Feasibility Studies;*Hand Strength;*Homeless Persons;Humans;Ireland;frailty;homeless;mobility;physical function;strength,,,N,N,Full text screen

The discharge type not only affects eligibility for benefits, but is associated with negative downstream consequences (e.g., homelessness, criminal justice involvement). However, limited empirical research has examined the mental health and substance use-related needs of veterans who were not Honorably discharged, and the few that have only focus on veterans who received punitive discharges. This study addressed gaps in the research literature on discharge status by examining differences in mental health, substance use, and attitudes toward psychological treatment among veterans who received Honorable, General Under Honorable Conditions, and Other Than Honorable (OTH) discharges. Young adult veterans (N = 734) were recruited online and completed a battery of self-report measures. Results indicated that veterans who received General and OTH discharges endorsed significantly greater rates of mental health conditions and substance misuse. They also reported more negative perceptions of mental health care. Because these veterans may also experience more barriers to accessing mental health services, it is critical to consider ways to connect these veterans with needed services.","L617228968     2017-07-14     2017-07-18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2017.07.011,adult;article;attitude to health;controlled study;female;human;major clinical study;male;mental health;mental health care;mental health service;military service;priority journal;psychiatric treatment;self report;substance abuse;veteran;young adult;Veterans,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Subgroups within the diverse methamphetamine-using population may have distinct treatment needs. Among a community-recruited sample of people who use crystal methamphetamine, we aimed to identify subgroups and characterize their overdose risk and access to addiction care. Methods: Data from prospective cohorts of people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada from 2014 to 2018 were used to conduct a repeated measures latent class analysis among participants who used crystal methamphetamine. Multivariable generalized estimating equations models were fit to determine the associated factors. Results: Among 824 eligible participants, a five-class model was identified as the best fit: (1) primary stimulant use (15.7%); (2) women engaged in sex work and opioid use (21.4%); (3) street income generation and opioid use (31.6%); (4) opioid agonist therapy (OAT) patients (22.3%); and (5) men who have sex with men (9.0%). In multivariable analyses, compared to the primary stimulant use group, non-fatal overdose was positively associated with street income generation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.49, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]=1.30â€“1.71), sex work (AOR = 1.38, 95% CI=1.20â€“1.59) and OAT (AOR = 1.22, 95% CI=1.06â€“1.41) subgroups; engagement in non-OAT addiction care was negatively associated with street income generation (AOR = 0.81, 95% CI=0.68â€“0.97) and sex work (AOR = 0.78, 95% CI=0.63â€“0.98) subgroups. Discussion: Socioeconomically marginalized subgroups with opioid and crystal methamphetamine co-use were at highest risk of non-fatal overdose and had poorer access to addiction care, highlighting the need for tailored interventions.","L2016451656     2022-01-18     2022-01-25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109274,methamphetamine;opiate agonist;adult;article;Canada;cohort analysis;controlled study;demography;drug use;female;food insecurity;health care access;homelessness;human;indigenous people;latent class analysis;male;measurement repeatability;men who have sex with men;prospective study;risk factor;urban area;Methamphetamine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

We aimed to evaluate (a) substances and dosages provided, and (b) outcomes of the program. Methods: We reviewed medical records of all COVID-19 isolation hotel shelter residents during May 2021. The primary outcome was successful completion of 14 days isolation, as directed by public health orders. Adverse events included (a) overdose; (b) intoxication; and (c) diversion, selling, or sharing of medications or alcohol. Results: Seventy-seven isolation hotel residents were assessed (mean age 42 Â± 14 years; 24% women). Sixty-two (81%) residents were provided medications, alcohol, or cigarettes. Seventeen residents (22%) received opioid agonist treatment (methadone, buprenorphine, or slow-release oral morphine) and 27 (35%) received hydromorphone. Thirty-one (40%) residents received prescriptions stimulants. Six (8%) residents received benzodiazepines and forty-two (55%) received alcohol. Over 14 days, mean daily dosages increased of hydromorphone (45 Â± 32 â€“ 57 Â± 42 mg), methylphenidate (51 Â± 28 â€“ 77 Â± 37 mg), and alcohol (12.3 Â± 7.6 â€“ 13.0 Â± 6.9 standard drinks).

We explored key variables from two theories of the development of suicidal thoughts and attempts (the interpersonal and three-step theories of suicide) to understand possible mechanisms underlying the association between opioid use and suicide risk. We hypothesized that interpersonal connections, variables reflecting psychological and physical pain, and variables that reduce fear of death (prior overdoses and risk-taking behaviors) would be associated with increased risk of thoughts of suicide. Methods: Participants (N = 141) were opioid users recruited from an epicenter of the opioid crisis in Philadelphia using a mobile research center and completed an interview to assess substance use, depression, medical comorbidities, and suicidal thoughts among other variables. Results: Univariate analyses showed that prior history of overdose, diagnosis of depression, older age, homelessness, and interpersonal connection were each associated with increased likelihood of endorsing thoughts of death/suicide. Multivariable analyses revealed prior history of overdose and depression were the variables most strongly associated with risk for thoughts of suicide. Conclusions: Consistent with two theories of the development of suicidal thoughts and attempts, exposure to variables that reduce fear of death (e.g., overdoses) were associated with suicidal thoughts. In contrast, other risk-taking behaviors, medical comorbidities, and substance use were not key predictors of suicidal thoughts in this sample.

Burns, National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Aims: Substance use disorders are consistently the most prevalent mental health diagnosis amongst homeless populations in Western countries. Although research has examined substance use among people experiencing homelessness, very few studies have looked at the nature of homelessness in people who use drugs and whether the state of homelessness infers particular risks to this group. Given this present study examined the prevalence and correlates of homelessness in an Australian national sample of people who inject drugs (PWID). Methods: Cross-sectional face-to-face interviews were conducted in 2014 with 898 Australians who injected drugs at least monthly in the past six months. Results: Three-quarters (74%) of the sample reported a lifetime history of homelessness. Of these, one-in-five were homeless at the time of interview and one-third reported a chronic homelessness history. The study also showed the majority of these participants had experienced a number of different forms of homelessness in their lifetimes, including rough sleeping (81%), couch surfing (77%), and staying in crisis accommodation (68%) or boarding houses/hostels (55%). Approximately one-quarter (27%) of participants reported being victims of violence during their most recent homelessness episode, most commonly in the form of being physically attacked or stood over. Conclusions: Episodes of homelessness among PWID are common and often chronic. Given that participants had experienced multiple forms of homelessness, further research examining the efficacy of supported housing programs for this group is warranted, particularly as a means of breaking the cycle of homelessness by providing stable housing and reducing the harms associated with substance use and homelessness. Further examination of the associations between risk factors and variables of homelessness, including forms and duration, among PWID are warranted.","L72176472     2016-02-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.07.1003,human;college;drug dependence;homelessness;housing;substance use;interview;Australian;lifespan;diagnosis;violence;prevalence;mental health;victim;sleep;risk;accommodation;population;examination;risk factor;substance abuse,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

While HRPs have effectively engaged PWUD, young people are under-represented in their services. Methods The Injection Drug Users Health Alliance Citywide Study (IDUCS) is the largest community-based study of PWUD in HRPs in the US. From 2014â€“2015, 2421 HRP participants across New York City (NYC) completed a cross-sectional survey. We investigated differences in socio-demographics, service utilization, and risk behaviors between young (aged 18â€“30) and older participants and examined factors associated with overdose among young participants. Results The study included 257 young participants. They were significantly more likely than older participants to be white, educated, uninsured, unstably housed or homeless, and have a history of incarceration and residential drug treatment. They were more likely to report recent overdose but less likely to report knowledge of naloxone. Young participants also had higher rates of alcohol, marijuana, benzodiazepine, and injection drug use, and related risk behaviors such as public injection. Factors associated with past year overdose among young participants included experiencing symptoms of psychological distress (AOR = 9.71), being unstably housed or homeless (AOR = 4.39), and utilizing detox (AOR = 4.20). Conclusions Young PWUD who access services at HRPs in NYC differ significantly from their older counterparts. New York City and other urban centers that attract young PWUD should consider implementing harm reduction oriented services tailored to the unique needs of young people.","L619207647     2017-11-16     2017-11-21 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.04.032,alcohol;benzodiazepine;buprenorphine;cannabinoid;cannabis;cocaine;diamorphine;methadone;methamphetamine;naloxone;narcotic analgesic agent;opiate;adult;age distribution;alcohol consumption;article;benzodiazepine dependence;cannabis use;Caucasian;cocaine dependence;controlled study;cross-sectional study;detoxification;distress syndrome;drug abuse;drug dependence;drug overdose;educational status;female;harm reduction;health care access;health care utilization;heroin dependence;high risk behavior;homeless person;human;intravenous drug abuse;major clinical study;male;medically uninsured;methadone treatment;methamphetamine dependence;opiate addiction;priority journal;prisoner;residential care;risk factor;United States;New York City,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Campbell, University of Calgary, Medicine and Community Health Sciences, Calgary, Canada","Background: Individuals who are experiencing homelessness often struggle to manage diabetes and consequently suffer more frequent and severe acute and chronic complications. There are many barriers to optimal diabetes self-management among this population, and this may be exacerbated by the lack of tailoring and customization of care to this unique population. Efforts to improve diabetes care for this population may or may not be reported in the formal literature. Understanding what interventions have been implemented and which have demonstrated success can help providers and organizations who are hoping to implement effective programs. Aim: Our objective was to summarize and synthesize the literature on tailored interventions for patients with diabetes management in populations who are experiencing homelessness. Method: We conducted a comprehensive scoping review that included both a formal search of the published literature (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus) and a thorough search of the grey literature. Eligible articles and documents included those that reported an intervention or guideline for the management of diabetes among persons experiencing homelessness. Title, abstract, and full text review were completed in duplicate. Results: Our search of the academic literature found 660 citations, 155 of these underwent full-text review, of which 57 articles met criteria for inclusion. Our grey literature search identified 837 documents, of which 144 met criteria for inclusion. In sum, 201 articles and documents were included. The types of interventions ranged from instrumental supports (housing, n=9; diet/nutrition n=5; and medications/pharmacy-based interventions, n=9) to multifaceted approaches to providing care to this population (n=27). Others were focused on diabetes-specific care: Patient education (n=13); Foot care (n=23); Eye assessments (n=5); Point-of-care screening (n=5); Oral health (n=5); Case management/navigation (n=9); and Electronic registries or tools (n=11). Others described interventions focused on the location of diabetes care: Street medicine/outreach (n=25); and Shelter-based care (n=6). A number of articles provided recommendations for providers and policy-makers (n=45) or the public (n=2); and a few even described peer-led interventions (n=2). Only 20 articles evaluated outcomes quantitatively, including 10 which examined glycemic control; 9 of these studies found a clinically significant benefit related to the intervention, with A1C values decreasing by 1â€“2%. Other benefits included enhanced patient knowledge and self-management abilities, and increased detection of foot and eye complications. Discussion: Individuals with diabetes who are experiencing homelessness often struggle to manage their chronic condition. When care is tailored to suit their needs, outcomes may be improved. By collating and synthesizing information from diverse organizations and jurisdictions, we hope to facilitate the sharing of knowledge with health care providers who serve people experiencing homelessness.","L2018509342     2022-06-17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1016/j.diabres.2022.109565,adult;case management;chronic disease;Cinahl;complication;conference abstract;diabetes mellitus;diabetic patient;Embase;female;foot care;glycemic control;grey literature;health;health care personnel;homelessness;housing;human;male;Medline;nutrition;organization;patient education;practice guideline;quantitative analysis;Scopus;self care;systematic review;Web of Science,,,N,N,Full text screen

Campbell, San Francisco Emergency Physicians Association, San Francisco, CA, United States","Objectives: Often overlaid with homelessness and chronic alcoholism, public inebriation is a challenging problem that frequently pressures a city's prehospital and ED delivery systems, as it is estimated that 32% of all drug related US ED visits involve alcohol. Facing escalating ambulance diversion rates (25% at some hospitals) in 2002, the San Francisco Emergency Physician's Association partnered with local hospitals government, and the management consulting firm Mc-Kinsey & Co. to form the â€œAmbulance Diversion Task Forceâ€ and design a comprehensive public-private service line for the safe prehospital sobering of the city's public inebriates. The 16-bed McMillan Sobering Center opened in 2003 in a refurbished former homeless shelter at a strategically located downtown location. Strict EMS field triage criteria were established for the transport of acutely intoxicated individuals by ambulance or minivan service directly to the center where they were immediately reassessed by trained nursing personnel and dispatched to a higher level of emergency care as needed. Intoxicated individuals failing EMS field triage criteria were safely transported by ambulance to an appropriate emergency department. Intoxicated clients who were medically cleared at an ED were subsequently offered minivan transport to the center for completion of sobering. Upon safely sobering, center clients were offered wrap-around social services, onsite primary care access, and fast-track to local housing services. From 2003 to 2011, 7,554 unique clients generated 26,530 encounters. 86.6% of encounters fully sobered and were safely discharged. 3.8% of the visits required repatriation of a client back to a higher level of care, with the occurrence of 1 death over 8 years. 65.9% of visits arrived between 12pm-12am with an average length of stay of 6.82 hours. The center has become a successful model for the subsequent development of an â€œEMS High Utilizerâ€ intervention program as well as other innovative prehospital capacity carve outs such as medical respite and â€œfast trackâ€ psychiatric assessment centers.","L70796154     2012-07-07 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/j.1553-2712.2012.01372.x,alcohol;sleep;United States;emergency medicine;human;ambulance;emergency health service;city;hospital;alcohol intoxication;emergency ward;emergency care;social work;primary medical care;emergency physician;alcoholism;government;nursing staff;model;homelessness;housing;death;length of stay;San Francisco;Sleep,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Studies, mainly from the USA, have reported increased use of unscheduled healthcare by homeless individuals.We sought to compare the use of unscheduled emergency department (ED) and inpatient care between housed and homeless hospital patients in a high-income European setting in Dublin, Ireland. SETTING: A large university teaching hospital serving the south inner city in Dublin, Ireland. Patient data are collected on an electronic patient record within the hospital. PARTICIPANTS: We carried out an observational cross-sectional study using data on all ED visits (n=47â€‰174) and all unscheduled admissions under the general medical take (n=7031) in 2015. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The address field of the hospital's electronic patient record was used to identify patients living in emergency accommodation or rough sleeping (hereafter referred to as homeless). Data on demographic details, length of stay and diagnoses were extracted. RESULTS: In comparison with housed individuals in the hospital catchment area, homeless individuals had higher rates of ED attendance (0.16 attendances per person/annum vs 3.0 attendances per person/annum, respectively) and inpatient bed days (0.3 vs 4.4 bed days/person/annum). The rate of leaving ED before assessment was higher in homeless individuals (40% of ED attendances vs 15% of ED attendances in housed individuals). The mean age of homeless medical inpatients was 44.19 years (95% CI 42.98 to 45.40), whereas that of housed patients was 61.20 years (95% CI 60.72 to 61.68). Homeless patients were more likely to terminate an inpatient admission against medical advice (15% of admissions vs 2% of admissions in homeless individuals). CONCLUSION: Homeless patients represent a significant proportion of ED attendees and medical inpatients. In contrast to housed patients, the bulk of usage of unscheduled care by homeless people occurs in individuals aged 25-65 years.","2044-6055     NÃ­ Cheallaigh, ClÃ­ona     Orcid: 0000-0002-0842-425x     Cullivan, Sarah     Sears, Jess     Lawlee, Ann Marie     Browne, Joe     Kieran, Jennifer     Segurado, Ricardo     O'Carroll, Austin     O'Reilly, Fiona     Creagh, Donnacha     Bergin, Colm     Kenny, Rose Anne     Byrne, Declan     Journal Article     Observational Study     England     BMJ Open. 2017 Dec 1;7(11):e016420. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016420. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Use (ED)",10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016420,"Adolescent;Adult;Age Distribution;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Case-Control Studies;Chi-Square Distribution;Cross-Sectional Studies;Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data;Female;Health Services Needs and Demand/statistics & numerical data;Homeless Persons/*statistics & numerical data;Hospitals, Teaching;Hospitals, University;Humans;Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data;Ireland/epidemiology;Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Admission/*statistics & numerical data;Young Adult;epidemiology;homeless;hospitalised;form and declare: support from the Health Research Board, Ireland (HRB) and the;Health Services Executive, Ireland (HSE) for the submitted work;no financial;relationships with any organisations that might have an interest in the submitted;work in the previous 3 years, no other relationships or activities that could;appear to have influenced the submitted work.;Cesarean Section",,,Y,Y,Included

A total of 278 homeless and 222 non-homeless patients matched in age and gender were consecutively recruited. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected from medical records. A clinical interview was conducted using standardized instruments. The physical and mental QOL in both groups were lower than the normative data for Chinese general population, but there was no significant difference in any QOL domain between the two groups. Multivariate analyses of homeless patients revealed that male gender was associated with higher physical QOL, while living in cities and lower education level were associated with higher mental QOL. In non-homeless patients, use of second-generation antipsychotics was associated with lower physical QOL, while having more severe depressive symptoms was associated with lower mental QOL. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the contributing factors of QOL in both homeless and non-homeless patients.","L614046841     2017-01-19     2019-09-27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2017.01.016,neuroleptic agent;adult;article;Chinese;controlled study;depression;disease severity;educational status;female;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;mental disease;Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale;mood disorder;priority journal;quality of life;schizophrenia;sex difference;Short Form 12;urban population;Quality of Life,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This secondary-data analysis examined rates of homelessness and their relation to the therapeutic workplace intervention and alcohol use during the trial. Methods: In the trial, homeless, alcohol-dependent adults could work in a therapeutic workplace for 6 months and were randomly assigned to Unpaid Training, Paid Training, or Contingent Paid Training groups. Unpaid Training participants were not paid for working. Paid Training participants were paid for working. Contingent Paid Training participants were paid for working if they provided alcohol-negative breath samples. Rates of homelessness during the study were calculated for each participant and the three groups were compared. Mixed-effects regression models were conducted to examine the relation between alcohol use (i.e., heavy drinking, drinks per drinking day, and days of alcohol abstinence) and homelessness. Results: Unpaid Training, Paid Training, and Contingent Paid Training participants did not differ in the percentage of study days spent homeless (31%, 28%, 17%; respectively; F(2,94) = 1.732, p = 0.183). However, participants with more heavy drinking days (b = 0.350,p < 0.001), more drinks per drinking day (b = 0.267, p < 0.001), and fewer days of alcohol abstinence (b = 0.285, p < 0.001) spent more time homeless.

Many barriers exist for homeless people with mental health problems in accessing treatment yet little research has been done on service provision and quality of care for this group. The aim of this paper is to assess current service provision and identify barriers to care for homeless people with mental health problems in 14 European capital cities. METHOD: Two methods of data collection were employed; (i) In two highly deprived areas in each of the 14 European capital cities, homeless-specific services providing mental health, social care or general health services were assessed. Data were obtained on service characteristics, staff and programmes provided. (ii) Semi-structured interviews were conducted in each area with experts in mental health care provision for homeless people in order to determine the barriers to care and ways to overcome them. RESULTS: Across the 14 capital cities, 111 homeless-specific services were assessed. Input from professionally qualified mental health staff was reported as low, as were levels of active outreach and case finding. Out-of-hours service provision appears inadequate and high levels of service exclusion criteria were evident. Prejudice in the services towards homeless people, a lack of co-ordination amongst services, and the difficulties homeless people face in obtaining health insurance were identified as major barriers to service provision. CONCLUSIONS: While there is variability in service provision across European capital cities, the reported barriers to service accessibility are common. Homeless-specific services are more responsive to the initial needs of homeless people with mental health problems, while generic services tend to be more conducive to long term care. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of different service delivery models, including the most effective coordination of homeless specific and generic services.","1472-6963     Canavan, RÃ©amonn     Barry, Margaret M     Matanov, Aleksandra     Barros, Henrique     Gabor, Edina     Greacen, Tim     HolcnerovÃ¡, Petra     Kluge, Ulrike     Nicaise, Pablo     Moskalewicz, Jacek     DÃ­az-Olalla, JosÃ© Manuel     Strassmayr, Christa     Schene, Aart H     Soares, Joaquim J F     Gaddini, Andrea     Priebe, Stefan     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     BMC Health Serv Res. 2012 Jul 27;12:222. doi: 10.1186/1472-6963-12-222. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Access",10.1186/1472-6963-12-222,*Cities;Europe;*Health Services Accessibility;Homeless Persons/*psychology;Humans;Mental Disorders/*therapy;Mental Health Services/supply & distribution;Qualitative Research;Quality of Health Care,,,Y,N,Included

Few GP training programmes are located in such communities, despite GPs tending to work in the areas where they trained. An evaluation of NDCGP training programme was conducted by sending a self-administered questionnaire to all graduates of the programme (2013?17). Thirty-seven graduates (88%) responded to the questionnaire. Thirty-six (97%) were either working as GPs in an area of deprivation or their work included services to a marginalised group. These 36 (97%) respondents indicated that continuing to serve deprived communities was in their long-term plans. The training provided trainees with the knowledge, understanding and a specific skill set to equip them to work with the underserved.

These programs were developed in Canada and have had positive results; very few exist in the UK and Ireland. The aim of this study was to scope the feasibility and acceptability of implementing MAPs in Scotland. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using mixed-methods, we conducted two linked phases of work. Quantitative data were collected from the case records of 33 people accessing eight third sector services in Scotland and analysed in SPSS using descriptive and inferential statistics. Qualitative data were collected in Scotland via semi-structured interviews with 29 individuals in a range of roles, including strategic informants (n =â€‰12), service staff (n =â€‰8) and potential beneficiaries (n =â€‰9). Data were analysed using Framework Analysis in NVivo. RESULTS: The case record review revealed high levels of alcohol use, related health and social harms, illicit drug use, withdrawal symptoms, and mental and physical health problems. Most participants highlighted a lack of alcohol harm reduction services and the potential of MAPs to address this gap for this group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the potential for MAPs in Scotland to prevent harms for those experiencing homelessness and AUDs, due to high levels of need. Future research should examine the implementation of MAPs in Scotland in a range of service contexts to understand their effectiveness in addressing harms and promoting wellbeing for those experiencing AUDs and homelessness.","1465-3362     Carver, Hannah     Orcid: 0000-0002-6846-2661     Parkes, Tessa     Orcid: 0000-0002-0409-3254     Browne, Tania     Orcid: 0000-0003-2421-5156     Matheson, Catriona     Orcid: 0000-0002-7568-1125     Pauly, Bernie     Orcid: 0000-0002-4845-1383     CGA/19/14/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom     CGA/19/14/Chief Scientist Office [UK]/     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Australia     Drug Alcohol Rev. 2021 Feb;40(2):220-230. doi: 10.1111/dar.13178.

We assessed whether neighborhood of residence predicted rates of injecting initiation among a cohort of street-involved youth in Vancouver, British Columbia. Methods: We followed street-involved injecting naÃ¯ve youth aged 14-26 and compared rates of injecting initiation between youth residing in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighborhood (the site of a large street-based illicit drug market) to those living in other parts of the city. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed to determine whether residence in the DTES was independently associated with increased risk of initiation of injection drug use. Results: Between September, 2005 and November, 2011, 422 injection-naÃ¯ve individuals were followed, among whom 77 initiated injecting for an incidence density of injecting of 10.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0-18.8) per 100 person years. In a multivariate model, residence in the DTES was independently associated with initiating injection drug use (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]=2.16, 95% CI: 1.33-3.52, p=0.002). Conclusions: These results suggest neighborhood of residence affects the risk of initiation into injection drug use among street-involved youth. The development of prevention interventions should target high-risk neighborhoods where risk of initiating into injecting drug use may be greatest.

Our objective was to describe (1) the characteristics of adolescents aged 11â€“17 who experienced NFOD and (2) their receipt of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the 12 months following NFOD, compared with adults. Methods: We created a retrospective cohort using six Massachusetts state agency datasets linked at the individual level, with information on 98% of state residents. Individuals entered the cohort if they experienced NFOD between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014. We compared adolescents to adults experiencing NFOD, examining individual characteristics and receipt of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)â€”methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone. Results: Among 22,506 individuals who experienced NFOD during the study period, 195 (0.9%) were aged 11â€“17.

In the year prior to NFOD, 11% (21/195) of adolescents received a prescription opioid, compared to 43% of adults (P < 0.001), and <5% (<10/195) received any MOUD compared to 23% of adults (P < 0.001). In the 12 months after NFOD, only 8% (15/195) of adolescents received MOUD, compared to 29% of adults. Conclusion: Among individuals experiencing NFOD, adolescents were more likely to be female and less likely to have been prescribed opioids in the year prior. Few adolescents received MOUD before or after NFOD. Non-fatal overdose is a missed opportunity for starting evidence-based treatment in adolescents.","L2001233213     2018-11-06     2018-11-13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.09.020,"buprenorphine;methadone;naltrexone;adolescent;adult;anxiety disorder;article;child;cohort analysis;controlled study;depression;female;human;ICD-9;independent variable;male;Massachusetts;medicaid;opiate addiction;prescription;priority journal;private health insurance;public health insurance;retrospective study;Analgesics, Opioid;Adolescent",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Chatterjee, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, 70 Albany St., Boston, MA, United States","Background: Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) causes significant morbidity and mortality among people experiencing homelessness. We aimed to explore the unique way in which OUD impacts individuals experiencing homelessness as part of a family. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with adults experiencing OUD staying in Boston-area family shelters along with dependent children. We used Borkan's Immersion-Crystallization method to uncover themes from interview transcripts. Results: We conducted 14 interviews. Eleven participants identified as female and three as male. Mean age was 35 (range 24â€“51) and median number of children was 2.5 (range 1-5). Emergent themes fell in three categories: 1) Initiation of OUD: Many patients were introduced to opioids through physician prescriptions, with recreational use coming first for some. Parents and partners also contributed to opioid use. 2) Impact of OUD: Overdose, homelessness, and unemployment were common impacts of OUD. Many patients described co-morbid chronic pain and mental illness. Psychosocial trauma, prominently due to loss of child custody, was common. 3) Treatment for OUD: Childcare, transportation to treatment at distant sites, and requirements that interfered with life responsibilities were barriers to treatment that shelter-based opioid treatment (SBOT) allowed patients to overcome. Family unity was universally seen as motivation for treatment. Conclusions: According to a sample of adults experiencing OUD in the context of family homelessness, an ideal OUD treatment program would overcome logistical barriers, provide comprehensive treatment for comorbidities, support employment and housing needs, and focus care on the family. Future work should explore the generalizability and financial feasibility of this model.","L2000754500     2018-05-21     2018-10-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.04.012,"adult;article;Borkan Immersion Crystallization method;clinical article;community care;controlled study;electronic medical record;ethnicity;female;homelessness;human;ICD-10;male;methodology;middle aged;morbidity;mortality;motivation;opiate addiction;priority journal;qualitative analysis;semi structured interview;unemployment;young adult;Analgesics, Opioid",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Although access to rehabilitation is a human right under article 26 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the rehabilitation needs of individuals with homelessness have not been explored, and this project's purpose was to establish a baseline of need for this cohort. METHODS: A prospective audit of case discussions at an inclusion health service over a 2-month period in 2018. RESULTS: Four multidisciplinary inclusion health clinics were observed with over 20 cases discussed in each and data were extracted using a bespoke audit data extraction tool. The inclusion health needs were diverse and complex with many unmet rehabilitation needs. Physical and cognitive rehabilitation needs were identified in over 50% of cases discussed. Musculoskeletal problems and acquired brain injuries were the most common cause of activity limitation. Most had concurrent medical conditions and addiction and/or mental health needs. None had access to rehabilitation services. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that the rehabilitative needs of this cohort are significant and are not being met through traditional models of care.

Methods: Using admissions age 55 + involving heroin (N = 299,073) from the 2012â€“2019 Treatment Episode Data Set-Admissions, we examined trends and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of three groups: (1) heroin-only admissions (i.e., not involving cocaine or methamphetamine), (2) heroin-cocaine admissions, and (3) heroin-methamphetamine admissions. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the research questions. Results: Between 2012 and 2019, the numbers of both heroin-only and heroin-cocaine admissions increased 2.3-fold and heroin-methamphetamine admissions increased seven-fold. First time heroin-methamphetamine admissions increased 18-fold. Heroin-methamphetamine admissions were concentrated in the Western region and heroin-cocaine admissions in the Northeastern region. Multivariable analyses showed a nearly 6 times higher relative risk ratio (RRR; 95% CI=5.24â€“6.74) for heroin-methamphetamine vs. heroin-only admissions in 2019 compared to 2012. Being non-Hispanic Black, compared to non-Hispanic White, was associated with a RRR of 2.4 (95% CI=2.34â€“2.46) for heroin-cocaine admissions and a RRR of 0.14 (95% CI=0.12â€“0.15) for heroin-methamphetamine admissions. Late-onset heroin use, experience of homelessness and other psychiatric problems, and past 30-day arrest episodes were associated with a higher likelihood of heroin-cocaine and heroin-methamphetamine admissions, while injection drug use (IDU) was associated with a higher likelihood of heroin-methamphetamine admissions only. Conclusions: Healthcare providers should assess and monitor psychostimulant, methamphetamine in particular, use among older adults. Those who use heroin and psychostimulants should receive substance use treatment and help to secure stable housing and meet other living needs.","L2016344034     2022-01-27     2022-02-16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109256,diamorphine;psychostimulant agent;adult;age distribution;aged;article;clinical feature;cocaine dependence;controlled study;disease association;female;geographic distribution;health care personnel;heroin dependence;homelessness;hospital admission;human;major clinical study;male;medical research;methamphetamine dependence;quality of life;race difference;sociodemographics;substance use;Heroin,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Yet little is known about persons who get committed and outcomes following commitment for opioid use. In the current cross-sectional study, we compared the characteristics of persons with and without a history of civil commitment, and the correlates of post-commitment abstinence. Methods: Between October 2017 and May 2018, we surveyed consecutive persons entering a brief, inpatient opioid detoxification (n = 292) regarding their lifetime experiences with civil commitment for opioid use. Results: Participants averaged 34.6 years of age, 27.1% were female, and 78.1% were White. Seventy-eight (26.7%) experienced civil commitment for opioid use at least once in their lifetime. Committed individuals had significantly higher rates of fentanyl, heroin, and injection drug use, drug overdoses, past incarceration, current criminal justice involvement, and past medication treatment for opioid use (p <.05). The average time to relapse following commitment was 72 days, although 33.8% relapsed on the same day of their release. Longer post-commitment abstinence was significantly associated with post-commitment medication treatment, higher perceived procedural justice (i.e., fairness) during the commitment hearing, positive attitude and higher motivation at the end of commitment, and improvement in attitude during commitment (p <.05). Conclusion: Opioid users who experience civil commitment constitute an especially high risk group. A positive commitment experience and post-commitment medication treatment are associated with longer post-commitment abstinence.","L2001215556     2018-10-30     2018-11-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.10.001,"diamorphine;fentanyl;abstinence;adult;article;attitude;involuntary commitment;criminal justice;cross-sectional study;drug detoxification;drug overdose;employment;experience;female;high risk population;homelessness;human;injection drug user;legal aspect;major clinical study;male;motivation;opiate addiction;priority journal;relapse;social behavior;Analgesics, Opioid;Civilization",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

We aim to classify poly-substance use profiles of PWID and to examine differences in these profiles in Los Angeles (LA) and San Francisco (SF). Methods: Between 2011 and 2013, PWID in SF and LA participated in a cross-sectional study on injection initiation (N= 777). Interviews included questions on demographics, drugs used and route of administration for the past month. Drug use items were dichotomized into yes/no responses and those with responses greater than 15% prevalence were used as indicators in city-based latent class analyses to identify classes of substance use profiles. Demographic covariates were used as predictors for class membership. Results: The total sample was racially/ethnically diverse, a quarter female, and split evenly between cities (SF N= 380, LA N= 397). Different sets of three classes were identified to describe substance use profiles in each region. In SF, the classes were â€œHeroin and Crackâ€ (41%), â€œPrimarily Methamphetamineâ€ (40%), and â€œHeroin and poly-substance useâ€ (18%). In LA, the classes were â€œPrimarily Heroinâ€ (59%), â€œPrimarily Methamphetamineâ€ (13%), and â€œHeroin and nonmedical use of prescription drugsâ€ (28%). Age; gay, lesbian, or bisexual (GLB) identification; homelessness, and race/ethnicity were significant predictors of class membership in LA sample; in contrast, only age, GLB, and race/ethnicity were significant predictors of latent class in SF sample. Conclusions: Our analyses of poly-substance use profiles in SF and LA suggests that they can be classified for PWID and differ by city and for various demographic covariates. Future research should examine the associations between poly-substance use with health behaviors and outcomes. Better understanding of poly-substance use profiles can be used to better inform intervention efforts.","L72176507     2016-02-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.07.1038,"diamorphine;methamphetamine;prescription drug;United States;human;college;drug dependence;substance use;city;female;health behavior;bisexuality;injection;prevalence;homosexual male;cross-sectional study;homosexual female;homelessness;drug use;interview;Poly(A)-Binding Protein II;RNA, Messenger;Poly A-U;Poly I-C;Poly(A)-Binding Proteins;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Poly G;Poly T;Polylysine;Polyglactin 910;Polymethyl Methacrylate",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

As a step towards filling this gap in knowledge, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the prevalence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism symptoms in a group of long-term homeless people. The entire caseload ( Nâ€‰=â€‰106) of a UK homeless outreach team was screened (excluding individuals born outside of the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland) using an in-depth, semi-structured interview with keyworkers, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) diagnostic criteria. This showed adequate inter-rater reliability, as well as evidence of criterion and construct validity. Of the sample, 13 people (12.3%, 95% confidence interval (7.0, 20.4)) screened positive, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) autism criteria by keyworker report. A further nine people (8.5%, 95% confidence interval (4.5, 15.3)) were 'marginal', having autistic traits that were not quite sufficient to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) criteria. Those with elevated autistic traits, compared to those without, tended to be more socially isolated and less likely to use substances. This study has provided initial evidence that autistic traits are over-represented among homeless people and that autistic homeless people may show a distinct pattern of characteristics and needs.

These chapters include information from Ireland, a number of Asian countries, South Africa, Spain, the Czech Republic, and North America. From within the United States, the book presents different models for understanding, developing, and disseminating interventions for people that are homeless, and have mental illnesses and/or substance use disorders. The book explores the needs of special populations such as racial and ethnic minorities as well as those who experience mild developmental delays as well as mental illness and homelessness. Two chapters explore attitudes towards people that are homeless and that may have behavioral health problems.

Clarke, Cavan General Hospital, Cavan, Ireland","Case Report CH presented to Cavan General Hospital with a one day history of erythema and swelling over the right eye. This was associated with fever, lethargy and pain. CH was unable to open his right eye fully. There was normal visual acuity and eye movements. Diplopia was not a feature. The initial differential was periorbital cellulitis. CT brain was performed and showed no evidence of intra-cranial pathology and no suspicious bone lesions. Pansinusitis was shown. He had a WBC of 22.9 (neutrophils of 20.6) and a CRP of 110. CH was started on antibiotics as per local guidelines (cef-triaxone and clindamycin). On day 4 of admission CH developed diplopia on lateral gaze. A repeat CT showed increased inflammatory changes of the right maxillary and frontal sinuses, infraorbital soft tissue density under the superior orbital wall and proptosis suggestive of orbital cellulitis. It also showed subcutaneous soft tissue swelling suggestive of underlying abscess formation. MRSA was also grown on a nasal swab with Vancomycin started to cover. An MRI brain was performed which showed soft tissue oedema around the right orbit, osteomyelitis of the right frontal bone, as well as small subperiosteal collections extending into the right medial orbit and an intracranial subperiosteal collection. These findings confirmed a diagnosis of Pott's Puffy tumour. Treatment involved adding metronidazole and rifampicin. FESS (functional endoscopic sinus surgery) with drainage of the orbital abscess was performed in Temple Street Children's Hospital. IV antibiotics were eventually stopped one month from presentation and CH was discharged home on PO antibiotics for a further 3 weeks having made an excellent recovery. Discussion: Pott's Puffy tumour was first described by Dr Peri-val Pott in 1760. It is characterised by osteomyelitis of the frontal bone with associated subperiosteal abscess. This presents as a fluctuant, tender swelling over the forehead. It is a life threatening complication of infectious sinusitis. Complications include intracranial extension with epidural abscess, subdural empyema, meningitis and cerebral abscess. Treatment is through surgical drainage and prolonged IV antibiotics.","L628682089     2019-08-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/archdischild-2019-epa.741,clindamycin;metronidazole;rifampicin;vancomycin;bone lesion;brain abscess;case report;child;clinical article;complication;conference abstract;diplopia;drug combination;drug therapy;edema;endoscopic sinus surgery;epidural abscess;erythema;exophthalmos;eye movement;fever;forehead;frontal bone;gaze;general hospital;homeless youth;human;human cell;lethargy;male;maxilla;neoplasm;neutrophil;nose smear;nuclear magnetic resonance imaging;orbit cellulitis;osteomyelitis;pain;practice guideline;school child;sinusitis;soft tissue;subdural empyema;surgical drainage;visual acuity,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Clifford, University of Sydney Menzies Centre for Health Policy, Faculty of Medicine & Health, Sydney, Australia","Homelessness has serious consequences for the health of people experiencing homelessness, and presents a challenge to the provision of quality care by health services. Policymaking to address homelessness, as with other social determinants of health (SDH), is complicated by issues of complex causation, intersectoral working and the dominance of biomedicine within health policy. This paper investigates how policies addressing homelessness have been explored using formal policy process theories (PPT). It also examines how health (as an actor and an idea) has intersected with the issue of homelessness reaching policy agendas and in policy implementation. A systematised search of academic databases for peer-reviewed literature from 1986 to 2018 identified six studies of homelessness policy change from Australia, Canada, France and the United States. PPT were able to articulate the interplay of actors, ideas and structures in homelessness policymaking. When the health sector was involved, it tended to be in terms of healthcare service utilisation rather than a broader public health framework emphasising structural social determinants of homelessness. Tensions between differing the priorities of local homelessness actors and a biomedical evidence-based policy paradigm were noted. Future policy action on homelessness requires new models of intersectoral governance that account for the complexity of health determinants, a health workforce enabled to engage with the SDH, and meaningful inclusion of those with lived and living experience of homelessness in policy formulation.","L2002870316     2019-09-20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1016/j.healthpol.2019.08.011,Australia;Canada;France;health workforce;homelessness;human;public health;review;social determinants of health;tension;United States;Health Policy,,,N,N,Full text screen

Design/methodology/approach: The author reviewed the intended outcomes of the original guidance and then looked at a range of data from evaluations of current PIE services in UK and Ireland. Findings: The findings were that the PIE approach is effective in meeting the outcomes suggested by the original guidance; in reducing social exclusion and improving the mental health of homeless people; and in improving staff morale and interactions. Research limitations/implications: This is a practice-based evidence. There needs to be more practice-based evidence gathered, and it would be useful if there were some standardised measures, as long as these did not limit the richness of the data which suggests that PIEs have a wide, not narrow, impact. Practical implications: The implications are that homelessness services should use the PIE approach, and that they should be supported by clinically trained psychotherapists or psychologists; and that wider mental health services should look at the PIE approach in terms of working effectively with socially excluded people with complex needs/menta health problems. Social implications: PIEs are an effective way of working with socially excluded people with mental health problems/complex needs, enabling the reduction of social exclusion among this very excluded client group.

Homeless people have higher morbidity and mortality, use a disproportionate amount of healthcare resources and generate a large volume of potentially preventable healthcare and other costs compared to more privileged individuals. Homeless people frequently need the input of multiple health and social care providers. We sought to develop and pilot a person-centred, multi-disciplinary approach to care delivery through an Inclusion Health Integrated Care Programme for homeless people attending St James's Hospital. Methods: Action research approach: a programme was developed, and iteratively used and evaluated by the team at a weekly quality-improvement QI team meeting. Routinely collected administrative data was utilised to capture hospital presentations and length of stay for homeless individuals and the number of homeless people in the hospital catchment area. A survey was carried out to determine the views of hospital staff on the programme. Results: The Inclusion Health team, based in St James's Hospital SJH, Dublin, was piloted from August 2016- August 2017. The team consisted of a part-time consultant physician and a fulltime nurse manager funded by the National Nursing and Midwifery Planning and Development Unit. Patients were referred to the team by community-based health and social care providers or by hospital staff. The team reviewed patient cases during their inpatient admission, and continued to be involved in care co-ordination after discharge through a weekly inter-agency integrated care meeting. The team provided input to 360 homeless admissions during the oneyear pilot. The approach was feasible and acceptable, with on-going engagement and attendance at weekly meetings by hospital and NGO staff. Feedback from community-based agencies and hospital staff was that the Programme delivered ""a more coordinated approach to patient care, improved discharge planning with homeless services and streamlined admissions all of which have resulted in more positive patient outcomes."". During the pilot period, the number of homeless admissions to SJH fell from 0.03 to 0.017 per capita of homeless adults in Dublin per quarter. The mean length of stay for homeless adults in SJH fell from 16 days S.D 7 days to 7 days S.D. 2.5 days. The estimated bed days saving over the one-year pilot was 3,668. Limitations: A randomised controlled trial of integrated care versus no integrated care would enable more thorough assessment of intervention causality. A RCT design suitable for assessment of a complex intervention e.g. stepped wedge may be required. Conclusion: An Inclusion Health Integrated Care Programme is feasible and acceptable and offers benefits to patients and health care providers, with evidence of reduced need for costly unscheduled healthcare during the pilot programme.

M.",,eng,,"Health Research Board, Dublin, Ireland.","OBJECTIVES: Globally, problem gambling prevalence is estimated at between 0.1% and 5.8%. Problem gambling can have many negative consequences; including on physical, and psychological health, and social functioning. There is a need to better understand treatment uptake as only a small proportion seek treatment. This is the first Irish national study using routinely gathered health surveillance data to describe treated problem gambling. Results will inform service policy and planning. METHODS: An analysis of episodes treated for problem gambling collected by the National Drug Treatment Reporting System was undertaken. Included were episodes entering treatment between 2008 and 2019 (n = 2999). Variables of interest included service types accessed, demographics, socioeconomic information, referral and assessment details, current problems (up to five) and treatment history. RESULTS: The majority (93.8%) were male. One fifth (20.9%) lived with dependent children, 7.4% were homeless. There were high levels of employment (35.4%) and formal education qualifications; half (53.8%) had completed second or third level education. Problem gambling frequently co-occurred with problem use of other substances (47.3%), which was most commonly alcohol (85.6%), followed by cannabis (32.3%), cocaine (28.0%) and benzodiazepines (10.9%). The majority were treated at inpatient settings (56.1%) with many self-referrals (46.3%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into treated problem gambling nationally. Monitoring and surveillance can play a crucial role in measuring the successful efforts and help inform planning and treatment. The findings may have implications for treatment pathways.","2051-6967     Condron, Ita     Lyons, Suzi     Carew, Anne Marie     Journal Article     England     Ir J Psychol Med. 2022 May 26:1-8. doi: 10.1017/ipm.2022.20. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Gambling,All criteria",10.1017/ipm.2022.20,Gambling;Ireland;routine surveillance data;substance use;treatment,,,Y,N,Included

Conneely, School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland","Background People experiencing homelessness have higher standardised mortality rates and higher risk of death than the general population. In recent years, inclusion health services have developed internationally with the aim of addressing extreme health and social inequities. Much of the research exploring delivery of palliative care to people experiencing homelessness is qualitative. We are unaware of a study that has attempted to quantify the palliative care needs of people experiencing homelessness. Aim To apply cause-of-death based methodology of estimating palliative care needs to deaths of people experiencing homelessness. To evaluate the appropriateness of this methodology to quantify the palliative care needs of this population. Design Secondary data analysis of a previously reported observational study. Mortality data (2005-2015) of people experiencing homelessness was reviewed for illnesses (malignant and non-malignant) potentially requiring palliative care input, using specific International Classification of Diseases-10 codes. This method, developed by Murtagh et al, has been used widely internationally to calculate both the current and future palliative care needs of populations. Setting and participants: N=361 deaths of people experiencing homelessness in Dublin between 2005-2015. Results A minimum of 25% of all deaths of people experiencing homelessness would have benefitted from palliative care. This percentage increases according to age-group with at least 64% of people experiencing homelessness over the age of 60 years dying of illnesses which would benefit from palliative care input. Conclusions Estimating palliative care needs based on single underlying-cause of death has limitations when applying causeof- death based methodology to a population of people experiencing homelessness. Incorporating multimorbidity would provide a more accurate estimate of need. In developing a palliative care response to inclusion health, older people in homelessness should be considered a priority group.","L638890902     2022-09-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Conference Abstract,Health care - Access (Palliative Care)",10.1136/spcare-2021-PCC.114,adult;cause of death;conference abstract;controlled study;data analysis;groups by age;homelessness;human;International Classification of Diseases;major clinical study;middle aged;mortality;multiple chronic conditions;observational study;palliative therapy;quantitative analysis;Cause of Death;Palliative Care,,,Y,N,Included

Conneely, St Francis Hospice, Dublin, Ireland","Background: Homeless people with life-limiting illnesses have complex palliative care needs. The provision of palliative care to homeless people is complicated by the high rates of physical, mental and substance-misuse problems experienced by this population, by lack of stable accommodation and frequently lack of family to provide informal care. Aims and objectives: 1) To explore the experience of homelessness staff working with homeless people with a life-limiting illness in homeless accommodation in Dublin. 2) To identify areas for education and collaboration between palliative care and homeless services to improve the end-of-life care for homeless people in Dublin. Methods: Qualitative methodology was employed. Semi-structured 1:1 interviews were conducted with homelessness staff. The data was analyzed with thematic analysis. Results: 11 participants were recruited from 4 organisations. Key themes identified were poor communication between hospitals and homeless services, concerns about medication handling, uncertainty about prognosis particularly in non-malignant conditions, and concerns that they could not meet the care needs of an individual at the end-of-life. Participants felt that health and community services staff do not have knowledge of the structure and staffing levels in homeless services and assumed for example, there was nursing support. Participants identified a strong wish to support a service user at the end of their life but had substantial concerns that they were not adequately trained to do so. Participants would welcome education opportunities on the topic of end-of-life care and advanced care planning. Conclusion: The provision of palliative care to homeless people is complex. Understanding the needs of homeless people who have physical health, mental health and substance misuse problems is vital in providing person-centered care. Collaborative work including sharing of skills and education opportunities between health, palliative, homeless and social services is required to improve care for homeless people with life-limiting illnesses.","L622331404     2018-05-31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Conference Abstract,Health care - Quality (Palliative Care)",10.1177/0269216318769196,adult;clinical article;conference abstract;education;female;homeless person;homelessness;human;interview;Ireland;male;mental health;nursing;organization;palliative therapy;precancer;prognosis;qualitative research;skill;social welfare;social work;terminal care;thematic analysis;uncertainty,,,Y,N,Included

We report the continuum of care for HCV and describe predictors of treatment with DAAs among PWID in Seattle. Methods: We analyzed data from the 2018 Seattle area National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) survey of PWID. Persons â‰¥18 years of age who injected drugs in the past year and completed the core NHBS survey, a local survey supplement, and rapid HCV antibody testing were included. Among those who screened HCV antibody positive, we calculated proportions and 95 % confidence intervals for self-reported steps along the HCV care continuum. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds (AOR) of having received DAA therapy. Results: The sample included 533 PWID, 376 (71 %) of whom tested positive for antibodies to HCV. Among those who were HCV antibody positive, 94 % reported any prior HCV test, 81 % reported a prior confirmatory test, and 68 % reported a prior HCV diagnosis. Of those diagnosed, 26 % had undergone treatment and 18 % had been cured. In a multivariate model, being one year older (AOR 1.05 per year, 1.01âˆ’1.08) was predictive of DAA treatment, while homelessness (AOR 0.39, 0.19âˆ’0.80) and female gender (AOR 0.36, 0.16âˆ’0.78) were associated with a lower odds of DAA therapy. Conclusions: Despite widespread HCV testing among PWID in Seattle, treatment uptake remains low in the DAA era. In particular, treatment of women, younger adults and persons living homeless is lagging behind.","L2010687533     2021-01-19     2021-01-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108525,virus antibody;adult;age;antiviral therapy;article;cohort analysis;controlled study;data analysis;female;gender;health survey;hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;homelessness;human;immunoassay;injection drug user;major clinical study;male;middle aged;nonhuman;patient care;prediction;priority journal;urban area;Washington;Continuity of Patient Care,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

The World Health Organization has published targets to be achieved by 2030 as part of its global health sector strategy to eliminate viral hepatitis. Recent innovations in testing and treatment of HCV mean such goals are achievable with effective infrastructure, political will and funding. 'HepCare Europe' was a 3-year, EU-funded project involving four member states. It sought to develop, implement and evaluate interventions to improve HCV outcomes through multiple-level interventions, running between 2016 and 2019. This paper aims to summarize the methods and present the aggregate cascade of care figures for the Irish components of HepCare. 'HepCare Ireland' contained five integrated work packages: HepCheck, HepLink, HepFriend, HepEd and HepCost. Interventions included intensified screening, community-based assessment, linkage to specialist care, peer training and support, multidisciplinary educational resources and cost-effectiveness analysis. A total of 812 participants were recruited across the three clinical work packages in Ireland. Two hundred and fifty-seven (31.7%) of the tested participants had an HCV antibody-positive result, with 162 (63.0%) testing positive for HCV RNA. At the time of writing (6th of November 2019), 57 (54.8%) of participants put on treatment had achieved SVR12, with 44 (42.3%) still undergoing treatment. In HepCheck, HepLink.

Tackling diet related ill health and evidencing 'what works' is a key priority for the coalition government, particularly in respect of poorer socio-economic groups(2). Previous research has identified an emerging body of evidence on effective interventions for improving nutrition amongst low-income women(3). However, there is a group of women experiencing even sharper deprivation than those on low incomes, notably homeless mothers and their children(4). The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve nutrition and nutrition related health amongst homeless mothers and their children. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken following, where possible, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidance for undertaking systematic reviews(5). A total of 280 articles were identified by a structured search of eleven databases, a hand search of the grey literature and relevant journals and contact with experts. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts for relevance. Articles were only included if they were an empirical study focussing on a nutrition intervention for homeless pregnant women or homeless mothers and their children. Two reviewers independently extracted and scored all relevant articles for quality. Only two studies met the inclusion criteria, each of which was of low quality. For homeless mothers living in a shelter for homeless families nutrition education was successful in increasing nutrition knowledge but did not improve the diet of their young children(6,7). For catering staff in homeless shelters, implementing nutrition education is compounded by wider structural factors influencing food provision such as lack of sufficient funding(6). There is a lack of quality evidence surrounding effective nutrition interventions for homeless mothers and their children but this should not prevent policy work being carried out and evaluated considering the recent growth of homelessness in the UK.","L71002412     2013-03-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1017/S0029665112002182,nutrition;human;female;society;child;summer;systematic review;mother;health;homelessness;diet;lowest income group;nutrition education;United Kingdom;policy;food;government;catering service;pregnant woman;accommodation;household;empiricism;data base;funding;systematic review (topic);Only Child;Child,,,N,N,Full text screen

Much less is known about the impact of contextual factors, such as the socioeconomic circumstances, on the provision of care to socially marginalized groups. The objectives of this work were to assess the organisational characteristics of services providing mental health care for marginalized groups in 14 European capital cities and to explore the associations between organisational quality, service features and country-level characteristics. Methods: 617 services were assessed in two highly deprived areas in 14 European capital cities. A Quality Index of Service Organisation (QISO) was developed and applied across all sites. Service characteristics and country level socioeconomic indicators were tested and related with the Index using linear regressions and random intercept linear models. Results: The mean (standard deviation) of the QISO score (minimum = 0; maximum = 15) varied from 8.63 (2.23) in Ireland to 12.40 (2.07) in Hungary. The number of different programmes provided was the only service characteristic significantly correlated with the QISO (p < 0.05). The national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was inversely associated with the QISO. Nearly 15% of the variance of the QISO was attributed to country-level variables, with GDP explaining 12% of this variance. Conclusions: Socioeconomic contextual factors, in particular the national GDP are likely to influence the organisational quality of services providing mental health care for marginalized groups. Such factors should be considered in international comparative studies. Their significance for different types of services should be explored in further research.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 3 Total Times Cited: 3 Cited Reference Count: 32 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Quality (Mental Health) | USER-NOTES: {""Carolyn""=>[""Data not specific to homeless persons but they are included in the sample population.

To date, there is no nationally representative data on how tobacco dependence is treated and if and how smoking cessation is supported across the homeless sector. The aim of this study was to document smoking and e-cigarette policies of UK homeless services and identify areas of good practice and where improvements could be made. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with homeless centre staff was conducted between June 2020-December 2020 totalling 99 homeless centres. Quotas were stratified based on population and service type across Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and England. Interviews were conducted over the phone or online in a minority of cases. Survey questions were themed to assess, i) onsite smoking and e-cigarette (vaping) policies ii) screening and recording of smoking status, iii) cessation training and resources available to staff, iv) cessation support for service users. RESULTS: 92% accounted for smoking within their policies in some formÂ (stand-alone policy (56%) or embedded within another health and safety policy (36%)). 84% allowed smoking in at least some (indoor and outdoor) areas. In areas where smoking was not allowed, vaping was also disallowed in 96% of cases. Staff smoking rates were 23% and 62% of centres reported staff smoked with service users. Just over half (52%) reported screening and recording smoking status and 58% made referrals to Stop Smoking Services (SSS), although established links with SSS were low (12%) and most centres did not provide staff training on supporting smoking cessation. Areas of good practice included regular offers of smoking cessation support embedded in routine health reviews or visits from SSS and offering tangible harm reduction support. Areas for improvement include staff training, staff smoking with service users and skipping routine screening questions around smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is accounted for across different policy types and restricted in some areas within most settings. Smoking cessation support is not routinely offered across the sector and there is little involvement with the SSS.","1472-6963     Cox, Sharon     Murray, Jaimi     Ford, Allison     Holmes, Lucy     Robson, Deborah     Dawkins, Lynne     C64552/A29846/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom     Journal Article     England     BMC Health Serv Res. 2022 May 13;22(1):635. doi: 10.1186/s12913-022-08038-7. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s12913-022-08038-7,Adult;Cross-Sectional Studies;*Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems;*Homeless Persons;Humans;Policy;Smoking/epidemiology;United Kingdom/epidemiology;E-cigarette;Harm reduction;Homelessness;Policies;Smoking;Smoking cessation;Survey;Tobacco;Vaping;Smoke;Cesarean Section;Smoking Cessation;Great Britain,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Coyle, CHI at Temple Street Ireland, Ireland","Introduction: Respiratory tract diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. This study aimed to compare respiratory illness rates and aetiology requiring hospitalization in 2019 (pre-COVID lockdown in Ireland) and 2020 (during COVID lockdown in Ireland). Methodology: Data from medical admissions were retrospectively collected from the emergency department admissions record of a Tertiary Paediatric Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. This study focused on September, October and November in 2019 and 2020. The documented reason for admission in each case was noted; these were transcribed and grouped into categories. Reasons for admission under the category of respiratory included: bronchiolitis, lower respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, wheeze, stridor and exacerbation of asthma. Rates of admission in this category were compared from 2019 versus 2020. Rates of investigative nasopharyngeal swabs for these admissions were documented, as well as the resultant viruses isolated. The results were compared across 2019 and 2020. Results: 1040 admission were included in the study. Of these, 620 were in 2019 and 420 in 2020. This alone shows a decrease of 32% in the admissions rate to Temple Street Children's hospital during COVID-19 restrictions. Of the 620 admissions across September, October and November 2019, 265 were attributed to respiratory illnesses (42.77%). In the same time period of 2020, only 67 admissions were attributed to respiratory causes (15.95%). This shows a dramatic decrease in the number of paediatric respiratory illnesses requiring hospital admission. There was a decrease in the number of respiratory panel nasopharyngeal swabs taken in 2020 compared to 2019, although 89% of respiratory admissions were swabbed for Sars-CoV-2 in 2020. Respiratory syncytial virus accounted for 54.60% of respiratory admissions swabbed in 2019 versus a 0% isolation rate in 2020. The table below further outlines virology differences between 2019 and 2020. (table) Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic related social restrictions dramatically interfered with the seasonality of childhood respiratory illnesses. This was reflected in the unexpected reduction in the number of hospitalizations in the paediatric population during this period. There is also an obvious stark contrast in the viruses isolated in children presenting with respiratory illnesses in 2019 and 2020. This study raises serious questions and concerns regarding paediatric immunity to respiratory illnesses and begs the question: will we experience a more severe respiratory season in 2021?","L636813926     2022-01-11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Physical health condition - Respiratory Illness | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1080/2331205X.2021.2002558,asthma;bronchiolitis;child;conference abstract;emergency ward;female;genetic transcription;homeless youth;hospital admission;hospitalization;human;Human respiratory syncytial virus;immunity;Ireland;lockdown;lower respiratory tract infection;male;nasopharyngeal swab;nonhuman;pandemic;pediatric hospital;retrospective study;seasonal variation;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;stridor;upper respiratory tract infection;virology;wheezing,,,N,N,Full text screen

Cronin, Department of Infectious Diseases, University College Hospital, Galway, Ireland","Introduction: Cryptococcal meningitis is an infrequently encountered condition in medically developed countries, where cases are comprised mainly of newly diagnosed HIV patients and patients receiving immunosuppressant therapies. The 3-month mortality rate during management of acute cryptococcal meningitis in all patient groups is approximately 20 %. (1) Case presentation: We report the case of a 57 year old homeless gentleman with chronic alcohol dependence who presented with a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure. The patient denied any alcohol consumption in the preceding 3 days. His GCS was 14/15 and he was agitated on review. He was orientated to person but not time or place. He denied any symptoms or past medical history of note. On examination the patient was tachypnoeic and pyrexial, with fine crackles noted at the left lung base on auscultation. Inflammatory markers were elevated and his chest x ray was unremarkable. The patient was treated for alcohol withdrawal (as the presumed aetiology of his seizure) and was commenced on antimicrobial treatment to cover for suspected aspiration pneumonia. The patient continued to deteriorate clinically despite escalation of antimicrobial treatment. Day 4 post admission blood cultures reported the growth of a fungus to be identified as cryptococcus neoformans. Cerebrospinal fluid culture following lumbar puncture confirmed cryptococcal meningitis. The patient underwent induction therapy with intravenous amphotericin and flucytosine and subsequently maintenance therapy with high dose oral fluconazole. Discussion: This case highlights the importance considering central nervous system infection in patients with altered mental status-particularly those with pyrexia or elevated inflammatory markers. The patient's viral serology (including Human Immunodeficiency Virus) was negative, and subsequent laboratory and imaging investigations did not identify any evidence of an immunodeficient state. The patient was managed with reference to the American Society of Infectious Diseases guidelines for the management of cryptococcal disease.

People who use drugs, in particular opioid users, have increased vulnerability. Targeted adaptations of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) are required to protect this vulnerable population and the healthcare workers providing services. In this article we describe and discuss the associated evidence for the measures implemented to reduce the risks associated with COVID-19 to Irish OAT services. Irish OAT services have implemented the following measures: reduced supervision requirements, increased the use of virtual patient care, streamlined assessment and induction processes to remove barriers to OAT access, provided home delivery of medications, increased access to naloxone and overdose programmes, targeted health and social interventions for the homeless and reduced our prison population. For now, non-essential services including drug and blood-borne virus screening and hepatitis C treatment have been postponed. Planning and review of Irish OAT services is ongoing so that further adaptations can be implemented as challenges emerge. Rapid adaptation of OAT services is required to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on patients, staff and the general public. Ongoing evaluation of these measures is critical since many of these changes may have an enormous impact on health and social care outcomes and be cost saving in a post-COVID future. Furthermore, these positive changes may address some of the social and health inequalities experienced by so many.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Access (Opioid treatment) | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No empirical data,No full text available",,Opioid agonist therapy;OAT;COVID-19;INJECT DRUGS;HEPATITIS-C;PEOPLE;HIV,,,N,N,Full text screen

Prisons are a key location to identify, treat and prevent HCV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID). Understanding prisoners' lived experiences of the HCV continuum of care informs how HCV care can be effectively delivered to this marginalised and high-risk population. This study aimed to explore Irish prisoners' experience of prison and community-based HCV care. We conducted one-to-one interviews with 25 male prisoners with chronic HCV infection. Data collection and analysis was informed by grounded theory. The mean age of participants and first incarceration was 39.5 and 18.3 years respectively. The mean number of incarcerations was eight. The following themes were identified: medical and social factors influencing engagement (fear of treatment and lack of knowledge, HCV relevance and competing priorities), adverse impact of HCV on health and wellness, positive experience of prison life and health care and the transformative clinical and non-clinical changes associated with HCV treatment and cure. Findings suggest that prison release was associated with multiple stressors including homelessness and drug dependence which quickly eroded the health benefits gained during incarceration. The study generated a substantive theory of the need to increase the importance of HCV care among the routine competing priorities associated with the lives of PWID. HCV infected prisoners often lead complex lives and understanding their journeys through the HCV continuum can inform the development of meaningful HCV care pathways. Many challenges exist to optimising HCV treatment uptake in this group and incarceration is an opportunity to successfully engage HCV infected prisoners who underutilise and are underserved by community-based medical services. Support and linkage to care on release is essential to optimising HCV management.","1932-6203     Crowley, Desmond     Orcid: 0000-0002-8491-9596     Cullen, Walter     Lambert, John S     Van Hout, Marie Claire     Journal Article     United States     PLoS One. 2019 Sep 11;14(9):e0222186. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0222186. eCollection 2019. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Use (Hep C) | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population | USER-NOTES: {""Carolyn""=>[""Homelessness as dependent variable.

However, there is growing concern regarding the increasing methamphetamine use among those on OAT, as well as the impact of such use may have on OAT retention and outcomes. We sought to identify the predictors of crystal methamphetamine initiation or re-initiation among people on OAT, in order to facilitate the development of effective preventive strategies. Methods: We employed multivariable generalized estimating equations to identify the predictors of crystal methamphetamine use initiation or re-initiation among those who were on OAT within two prospective cohorts in Vancouver, Canada between 2005 and 2020. Results: Of the 1281 participants receiving OAT, the median age was 43 years, and 59.2 % were male at baseline. During study follow-up, 564 (44.0 %) initiated or re-initiated crystal methamphetamine use while receiving OAT. In a multivariable model, a higher crystal methamphetamine use initiation or re-initiation rate was positively associated with younger age, unstable housing, unprotected sex, history of crystal methamphetamine use, as well as recent cocaine, prescription opioid, and unregulated opioid use (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: We identified high and increasing rates of crystal methamphetamine use initiation or re-initiation among our sample of people on OAT. Intervention strategies including housing program referral, sexual risk reduction, and integrated treatment approaches targeting polysubstance use are urgently needed to reduce the risks associated with methamphetamine use as well as the co-use of methamphetamine and opioids.","L2020210175     2022-09-21 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109624,"adult;age;article;Canada;cohort analysis;controlled study;crystal;drug therapy;female;follow up;housing;human;human experiment;major clinical study;male;patient referral;prescription;prospective study;risk reduction;unprotected sex;cocaine;methamphetamine;opiate;opiate agonist;Cohort Studies;Analgesics, Opioid;Methamphetamine",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Focusing on two such groups, the aim of this article is to synthesise international research on the life-course and structural determinants of positive subjective health for older homeless people and older Irish Travellers. Two scoping reviews were conducted (one for each group) to capture state-of-the art knowledge published from 1998 to 2020. The reviews were completed from July to December 2018, and repeated from March to April 2020. Thirty-eight publications were included in the final sample (older Travellers: 10 sources; older homeless: 28 sources). Specific life-course and structural factors were evident for both groups, as well as commonalities with respect to: accumulated exclusions; complexity of needs; accommodation adequacy/stability and independence and resilience. Research gaps are identified concerning: lack of conceptualisation of positive health; the application of life-course perspectives and the absence of an environmental gerontological analysis of the situations of both groups.","1365-2524     Cush, Peter     Walsh, Kieran     Orcid: 0000-0002-6718-193x     Carroll, BrÃ­dÃ­n     O'Donovan, Diarmuid     Keogh, Sinead     Scharf, Thomas     MacFarlane, Anne     O'Shea, Eamon     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Review     England     Health Soc Care Community. 2020 Nov;28(6):1961-1978. doi: 10.1111/hsc.13060.

The aim of the study was to increase knowledge of well-being in very old persons by combining assessments and perceptions using the Philadelphia Geriatric Morale Scale (PGCMS). Method: In a mixed method, convergent parallel design, 52 persons 80 years or older were assessed and interviewed using the PGCMS to combine assessment of morale and descriptions of perceptions of well-being using a mixed method approach. Results: Quantitative and qualitative results converged in four areas: not feeling lonely and being included, rating and perceiving health as good, high physical function/ability and being physically active, living in own house and feeling at home. Areas perceived as important to well-being captured only in qualitative analysis were having freedom and engagement. An example of insights not achievable from the quantitative or qualitative analysis alone was that individuals with high morale expressed anxiety about losing their health due to potential ageing-related threats and that individuals with low morale struggled with acceptance. Acceptance was the key strategy for handling adverse consequences of ageing in all described areas. Conclusion: When using standardized assessment scales in clinical practice, it could be useful to combine quantitative and qualitative data. Acceptance was key for well-being; however, acceptance could be resigned or reorienting in nature.","L2007990112     2020-10-12     2020-11-05 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.archger.2020.104275,aged;aging;analysis;anxiety;article;clinical practice;controlled study;female;freedom;functional status assessment;homelessness;human;life satisfaction;loneliness;male;mixed method analysis;morality;parallel design;perception;Philadelphia Geriatric Morale Scale;physical activity;physical performance;priority journal;psychological well-being;qualitative analysis;quality of life;quantitative analysis;social acceptance;Sweden;very elderly,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

In recent years, lack of affordable housing, unemployment and shortage of rental properties have been the primary driving factors for the potentially devastating impact of familial homelessness in our society [1]. Our aim was to evaluate current knowledge on the psychological impact of homelessness in children. Using the PRISMA model, we performed a review of the currently available literature on the psychological impact of homelessness on children. This concept was explored under two different categories-'transgenerational' and 'new-onset homelessness'. Hidden homelessness was also explored. Our literature review revealed several psychological morbidities which were unique to children. This includes developmental and learning delays, behavioural difficulties and increased levels of anxiety and depression [66, 77, 40, 81, 42]. This has been demonstrated by poorer performance in school testing and increased levels of aggression. Anxiety in children within this cohort has been shown to peak at time of dispersion from their stable home environment [67]. Our study highlights violence, aggression and poor academic learning outcomes to be just some of the key findings in our review of homelessness in childhood, worldwide. Unfortunately, there has been minimum research to date on paediatric homelessness within the context of the Irish population. We anticipate this review to be the first chapter in a multipart series investigation to evaluate the psychological morbidity of paediatric homelessness within the Irish Society.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 1 Total Times Cited: 1 Cited Reference Count: 84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1007/s11845-020-02256-w,Childhood homelessness;Familial homelessness;Homeless in Ireland;Psychological impact;MENTAL-HEALTH PROBLEMS;MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES;STREET CHILDREN;PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS;ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT;BEHAVIORAL-PROBLEMS;YOUNG-CHILDREN;SUBSTANCE USE;SELF-ESTEEM;RISK,,,N,N,Full text screen

There is substandard uptake in HCV assessment and treatment among people who inject drugs (PWID). Community fibroscanning is used to assess disease severity and target treatment. METHODS: A survey was administered to a cohort of chronically HCV infected patients attending a community fibroscanning clinic. Questions targeted diagnosis of HCV, suitability, willingness and barriers to engagement in treatment. Descriptive and regression analysis, with thematic analysis of open-ended data was conducted. RESULTS: There was high acceptance of community fibroscanning among this cohort with over 90% (68) attending. High levels of unemployment (90%) and homelessness (40%) were identified. Most patients were on methadone treatment and had been HCV infected for greater than 10 years with length of time since HCV diagnosis being significantly longer in patients with fibroscan scores > 8.5 kPa (P = 0.016). With each unit increase in methadone dose, the odds of the >8.5 fibroscan group increased by 5.2%. Patient identified barriers to engagement were alcohol and drug use, fear of HCV treatment and liver biopsy, imprisonment, distance to hospital and early morning appointments. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the usefulness of community fibroscanning. Identifying barriers to treatment in this cohort affords an opportunity to increase the treatment uptake. The availability of afternoon clinics and enhanced prison linkage are warranted.","2224-4018     Crowley, Des     Cullen, Walter     Laird, Eamon     Lambert, John S     Mc Hugh, Tina     Murphy, Carol     Van Hout, Marie Claire     Journal Article     Poland     J Transl Int Med. 2017 Jun 30;5(2):112-119. doi: 10.1515/jtim-2017-0017. eCollection 2017 Jun. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Use (Hep C)",10.1515/jtim-2017-0017,blood borne virus;drug users;fibroscan;hepatitis C virus;opiate substitution treatments,,,Y,Y,Included

This study aims to characterize heterogeneity in patterns of NPB and other opioid use among individuals with current opioid use disorder. Methods: The study recruited 356 participants in Dayton (Montgomery County), Ohio, area in 2017â€“2018 using targeted and Respondent Driven Sampling. Participants met the following criteria: 1) 18 years or older, 2) current moderate/severe opioid use disorder (DSM-5), 3) past 6-month NPB use. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify subgroups based on past 6-month (days of NPB and heroin/fentanyl use; use of NPB to get high; use of non-prescribed and prescribed pharmaceutical opioids; participation in formal treatment) and lifetime (years since first NPB and other illicit opioid use) characteristics. Selected auxiliary variables were compared across classes using Asparouhov and MuthÃ©n's 3-step approach. Results: 49.7% were female, and 88.8% were non-Hispanic whites. 89% used NPB to self-treat withdrawal. LCA resulted in three classes: â€œHeavy Heroin/Fentanyl Useâ€ (61%), â€œMore Formal Treatment Useâ€ (29%) and â€œIntense NPB Useâ€ (10%). After adjusting for multiple testing, the following past 6-month variables differed significantly between classes: injection as a primary route of heroin/fentanyl administration (p < 0.001), cocaine use (p = 0.044), unintentional drug overdose (p = 0.023), and homelessness (p = 0.044), with the â€œIntense NPB Useâ€ class having the lowest prevalences. Conclusion: Predominance of self-treatment goals and the association between more intense NPB use and lower risks of adverse consequences suggest potential harm minimization benefits of NPB use. More research is needed to understand consequences of NPB use over time.","L2002974959     2019-10-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107574,"buprenorphine;diamorphine;fentanyl;adult;age distribution;article;community assessment;comorbidity;controlled study;cross-sectional study;demography;descriptive research;disease severity;DSM-5;ethnic difference;female;harm reduction;homelessness;human;latent class analysis;major clinical study;male;Ohio;opiate addiction;prevalence;priority journal;self care;sex difference;social aspect;unlicensed drug use;withdrawal syndrome;Buprenorphine;Analgesics, Opioid",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

The main objective of the present study was to assess if childhood disadvantage accounts for poorer mental and physical health in adulthood, in second-generation Irish people. Design: Analysis of prospectively collected birth cohort data, with participants followed to midlife. Setting: England, Scotland and Wales. Participants: Approximately 17 000 babies born in a single week in 1958. Six per cent of the cohort were of second-generation Irish descent. Outcomes: Primary outcomes were common mental disorders assessed at age 44/45 and self-rated health at age 42. Secondary outcomes were those assessed at ages 23 and 33. Results: Relative to the rest of the cohort, secondgeneration Irish children grew up in marked material and social disadvantage, which tracked into early adulthood. By midlife, parity was reached between second-generation Irish cohort members and the rest of the sample on most disadvantage indicators. At age 23, Irish cohort members were more likely to screen positive for common mental disorders (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.94). This had reduced slightly by midlife (OR 1.27; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.69). Although at age 23 second-generation cohort members were just as likely to report poorer self-rated health (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.43), by midlife this difference had increased (OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.60). Adjustment for childhood and early adulthood adversity fully attenuated differences in adult health disadvantages. Conclusions: Social and material disadvantage experienced in childhood continues to have long-range adverse effects on physical and mental health at midlife, in second-generation Irish cohort members. This suggests important mechanisms over the lifecourse, which may have important policy implications in the settlement of migrant families.","Cited By :22     Export Date: 18 November 2022     Correspondence Address: Das-Munshi, J.; Health Service and Population Research Department, , London, United Kingdom; email: jayati.das-munshi@kcl.ac.uk | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001335,adult;alcohol consumption;article;emotion;health;homelessness;human;major clinical study;mental disease;mental health;prospective study;self concept;smoking;social support;unemployment;United Kingdom;Cohort Studies,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Each Service User will have a complexity of needs which will require support in some or all of the following areas: Drug specific interventions Housing and tenancy support and independent living Mental/physical/intellectual disability General health services and health promotion Employment (incl. community employment), work placements Community integration, social and recreational activities Education and training, personal development Justice, law and criminal issues support Family support and childcare Budgeting and money management Transition programmes (eg. structured pre-induction) Aftercare No one agency will be able to provide the range of supports that the service user needs. Therefore, through the NDRF process of comprehensive assessment, key working, care planning and case management, the specific need of the service user can be established and the services they require can be coordinated. Change management process, practice change, targetted population and stakeholders, timeline Following a pilot roll-out in ten sites, the NDRF was evaluated in 2013 and is now being implemented nationally in services who work with drug-using individuals. The change management process has included the following: Nomination of local rehabilitation drivers through the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces Inclusion in the National Drug Treatment Reporting System Inclusion in the HSE Operation Plan as a national key performance indicator Inclusion in service level agreements between the HSE and section 39 funded projects Inclusion as sample evidence in the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare workbooks for the Addiction Services Highlights: Achievements to date include: Development and sharing of protocols and resources online and through the rehabilitation drivers network Development of shared assessment criteria and referral pathways in a number of Drug and Alcohol Task Force areas Local memorandum of understanding between services in Drug and Alcohol Task Forces on referral processes Planned development of a competency framework for staff who work with drug-using clients, in collaboration with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and HSE Mental Health Development of competency based training resources Under the NDRF, the Service User can expect person-centred care, consistency of care, integrated care based on assessed need, individualised care plan and quality service provision. Sustainability and transferability: The NDRF is supported at a local level by the Drug and Alcohol Task Force through the nominated rehabilitation driver, and by sectors at a national level through representation on National Drug Rehabilitation Implementation Committee (NDRIC). The NDRF is supported by a national Coordinator within HSE Social Inclusion and by the National Oversight Forum on Drugs. The MOUs on referral processes in many areas and the successful implementation of shared assessments and referrals in the South are supported by the sharing of information, tools, policies, resources and training by the rehabilitation drivers through the national Coordinator.

We characterized rates of non-fatal stimulant overdose identified outside of health care settings among women at high risk. Methods: Homeless and unstably housed women in San Francisco, California using stimulants were administered questionnaires on drug use and outcomes (stimulant overdose, health care utilization) monthly for six months. Based on pilot interviews, stimulant overdose during follow-up was defined as acute toxicity from stimulant use (â€œover-ampingâ€) resulting in â€œfeeling sick, really scared, or like one's life may be in dangerâ€. Poisson regression estimated unadjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) comparing participant characteristics. Results: We included 160 women (41% Black, 26% White, 15% Latina, median age 54 years) using crack cocaine (81%), methamphetamine (48%), and powdered cocaine (36%). Participants reported 67 non-fatal stimulant overdoses over 685 person-months of observation, a rate of 117.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI 85.8â€“160.5). Rates were higher among participants who were Latina vs. White (IRR 4.18 [1.60â€“10.94]), used methamphetamine (IRR 1.80 [0.96â€“3.38]), or used any stimulant daily/almost daily (IRR 2.63 [1.41â€“4.91]). Among women reporting stimulant overdose, 4% received emergency and 3% inpatient care for overdose of any drug. Conclusions: Women in this setting, particularly those who used stimulants frequently or used methamphetamine, experienced high non-fatal stimulant overdose and rarely received health care for these events.

Dayton, 2213 McElderry Street, 2nd Floor, Baltimore, MD, United States","Background: Little is known about trends in overdose behaviors. This study explored non-fatal overdose and engagement in overdose prevention behaviors and compared these trends to city-wide overdose fatality rates from 2017 to 2019 in Baltimore, MD. Methods: The analysis included people who used opioids (PWUO; N = 502) recruited through a community-based study. Enrollment date was used to categorize participants into annual quarters. Logistic regression models examined change in overdose experiences and prevention behaviors with time. Baltimore's fatal overdoses were also mapped over the study period to assess overlaps in trends. Results: The majority of the sample were male(68 %), Black(61 %), reported past 6 months homelessness(56 %), and were on average 45 years old. Most had witnessed(61 %), and 28 % had personally experienced an overdose in the past 6 months. Witnessing overdose marginally increased(aÎ² = 0.182;p = 0.058) while experiencing overdose did not significantly change by enrollment quarter. Most participants had or had been prescribed naloxone(72 %), and one fifth(22 %) regularly carried naloxone, with both access to(aÎ² = 0,408;p = 0.002) and carrying naloxone(aÎ² = 0.302;p = 0.006) increasing over time. Overdose communication remained stable, with 63 % of participants reporting discussing overdose sometimes/often. Among participants who injected (n = 376), regularly injecting alone decreased(aÎ²=-0.207;p = 0.055), and reporting others often/always having naloxone with them when injecting increased over time(aÎ² = 0.573;p < 0.001). Conclusions: Witnessed overdose marginally increased from 2017 to 2019, aligning with city trends of fatal overdose. Overdose prevention behaviors significantly increased over time. Despite reporting having naloxone or a naloxone prescription, most PWUO did not regularly carry naloxone, and many used alone. Social network diffusion interventions may be a strategy to promote normative overdose prevention behaviors.","L2011240771     2021-03-10     2021-08-17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108650,"naloxone;adult;article;behavior change;female;harm reduction;homelessness;human;injection drug user;intoxication;male;middle aged;mortality rate;Analgesics, Opioid;Baltimore",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This statement has been issued taking into account the international migration crises related to thousands of deaths worldwide, in which the utility of these traditional means of identification has been sporadic to non-existent. The statement is however not limited to deaths related to the migration crises, as similar problems may occur in fatalities en masse such as in natural disasters and armed conflicts, and on a smaller scale in cases of homeless or otherwise socioeconomically disadvantaged persons. The number of reports on personal identification based on sound anthropological methodology is increasing in the scientific literature. However, more research is needed to develop evidence-based standard operating procedures and statistical frameworks. It remains essential to raise awareness among forensic practitioners, law enforcement, and judiciary professionals on the utility of forensic anthropology in cases where it can provide sufficient information for identification.","L2007601904     2020-09-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110456,adult;article;awareness;cell migration;controlled study;Europe;fatality;finger dermatoglyphics;forensic anthropology;genetic analysis;human;law enforcement;natural disaster;odontology;physician;scientific literature;sound;war,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

There are substantive and recognised gaps in the process of translating research findings into practice and policy. In order to overcome some of these translational difficulties, a number of strategies have been proposed for researchers. These include greater use of theoretical approaches in research focused on implementation, and use of a wider range of research methods appropriate to policy questions and the wider social context in which they are placed. However, questions remain about how to combine theory and method in implementation research. In this paper, we respond to these proposals. Discussion: Focussing on a contemporary social theory, Normalisation Process Theory, and a participatory research methodology, Participatory Learning and Action, we discuss the potential of their combined use for implementation research. We note ways in which Normalisation Process Theory and Participatory Learning and Action are congruent and may therefore be used as heuristic devices to explore, better understand and support implementation. We also provide examples of their use in our own research programme about community involvement in primary healthcare. Conclusions: Normalisation Process Theory alone has, to date, offered useful explanations for the success or otherwise of implementation projects post-implementation. We argue that Normalisation Process Theory can also be used to prospectively support implementation journeys. Furthermore, Normalisation Process Theory and Participatory Learning and Action can be used together so that interventions to support implementation work are devised and enacted with the expertise of key stakeholders. We propose that the specific combination of this theory and methodology possesses the potential, because of their combined heuristic force, to offer a more effective means of supporting implementation projects than either one might do on its own, and of providing deeper understandings of implementation contexts, rather than merely describing change.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 23 Total Times Cited: 23 Cited Reference Count: 73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong date",10.1186/s12913-016-1587-z,Primary healthcare;participatory learning & action research;Normalisation process theory;Implementation research;Theoretical frameworks;COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS;PAIN MANAGEMENT;OLDER-PEOPLE;DISSEMINATION;COMMUNITIES;IMPROVEMENT;DIFFUSION;FRAMEWORK;BEHAVIOR;LESSONS;Research Design;Health Services Research,,,N,N,Full text screen

Shea Blvd., Scottsdale, AZ, United States","Objective: Menopausal symptoms may differ by geography and ethnicity, but the impact of socioeconomic factors is less clear. The purpose of this study was to compare menopausal symptoms in women from areas of Arizona with different socioeconomic resources. Study design: Women aged 40â€“65 years in two cohorts were surveyed: (1) Phoenix women attending either a clinic for patients who are uninsured or a clinic for people experiencing homelessness; and (2) Scottsdale women living in zip codes with higher average income and neighborhood advantage (surveyed by mail). Surveys included the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) and demographic questions. Main outcome measures: GCS score by domain and subdomain, corrected for age, race, menopause stage and menopausal hormone therapy (HT). Results: Phoenix participants (N = 104) were 51.2 years old (SD 6.45), Hispanic (54.4%), White (28.2%) or African American (8.7%), and uninsured (53.0%). Scottsdale participants (N = 151) were 52.6 years old (SD 5.52), mostly White (94.7%) and insured (100%). Three percent of Phoenix women were on HT vs. 23.3% in Scottsdale (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed higher total GCS scores in the Phoenix vs. Scottsdale cohort (39.13 vs 30.14, p < 0.001), which was also seen in the psychological and somatic domains, as well as the anxiety and depression subdomains. No statistically significant differences were seen in the vasomotor or sexual dysfunction domains. Conclusion: In a group of women living in Arizona from distinct socioeconomic areas, significant differences were demonstrated in menopausal symptom bother specifically with hgiher psychological and somatic symptoms in women who were uniunsured or experiencing homelessness independent of age, race, menopause stage and HT use. Future studies controlling for co-morbidities associated with lower socioeconomic status such as depression would provide further insight into this population of midlife women.","L2014525930     2021-09-17     2022-09-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.maturitas.2021.08.110,adult;African American;Arizona;article;cohort analysis;controlled study;cross-sectional study;demography;female;health care survey;health disparity;Hispanic;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;medicaid;medically uninsured;menopausal syndrome;menopause;middle aged;sexual dysfunction;social status;socioeconomics;Cross-Sectional Studies;Menopause;United States;Health Resources;Cesarean Section,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods The Health Research Boardâ€™s (HRB) NPIRS data were analysed using SPSS to develop an overview of admissions with NFA recorded for the years 2007-2016 (n=2,176). Results In the period 2007-2016 there were 2,176 admissions with NFA recorded. In that 10-year period there was a 44% increase in admissions with NFA from 188 in 2007 to 271 in 2016. The analysis shows that the characteristics of this cohort have remained largely unchanged in the 10 years; almost three-quarters (1,598; 73.4%) were male, almost half (1,068; 49.1%) were less than 35 years of age and three-quarters (1,638; 75.2%) were less than 45 years. Three-quarters (1,643; 75.5%) were single and a similar proportion was unemployed (1,640; 75.4%). In addition, the highest proportion had a diagnosis of schizophrenia (621; 28.5%) followed by drugs/alcohol disorders (590; 27.1%). These characteristics are consistent with the single â€˜chronically homelessâ€™ people described in the literature. Discussion The paper concludes the need to use routinely collected data to help understand and address the need of specific homeless sub-groups particularly those on institutional circuits that include psychiatric in-patient facilities. To enable this it recommends the implementation of the individual health identifier as a matter of urgency.","Daly, A     Craig, S     O' Sullivan, E     Journal Article     Ireland     Ir Med J. 2019 Jan 15;112(1):853. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Use (Psychiatric)",,Adult;Age Factors;Alcoholism/epidemiology;Female;Homeless Persons/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Ireland/epidemiology;Male;Mental Disorders/*epidemiology;Middle Aged;Patient Admission/*statistics & numerical data;Schizophrenia/epidemiology;Sex Factors;Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology;Time Factors;Patient Admission,,,Y,N,Included

Methods: Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with progression to injecting weekly on a regular basis among a Canadian cohort of street-involved youth. Results: Among our sample of 405 youth who had initiated injecting at baseline or during study observation, the median age was 22 years (interquartile range [IQR]. = 21-24), and 72% (293) reported becoming a regular injector at some point after their first injection experience. Of these, the majority (n= 186, 63%) reported doing so within a month of initiating injection drug use. In multivariate analysis, the drug used at the first injection initiation event (opiates vs. cocaine vs. methamphetamine vs. other; all p>. 0.05) was not associated with progression; however, younger age at first injection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]. = 1.13), a history of childhood physical abuse (AOR. = 1.81), prior regular use of the drug first injected (AOR. = 1.77), and having a sexual partner present at the first injection event (AOR. = 2.65) independently predicted progression to regular injecting. Conclusion: These data highlight how quickly youth progress to become regular injectors after experimentation. Findings indicate that addressing childhood trauma and interventions such as evidence-based youth focused addiction treatment that could prevent or delay regular non-injection drug use, may reduce progression to regular injection drug use among this population.

The outbreaks differed in size (from under 100 to over 1000 newly reported HIV cases among PWID) and in the extent to which combined prevention had been implemented before, during, and after the outbreaks. Countries need to ensure high coverage of HIV prevention services and coverage higher than the current UNAIDS recommendation might be needed in areas in which short acting drugs are injected.

However, less is known about the use of multiple substances (polysubstance use), or factors associated with polysubstance use among YEH. The present study sought to identify subgroups of YEH based on their recent polysubstance use behavior, and investigate traumatic experiences, mental health and social network composition as predictors. Methods: YEH (N = 1,032; Mage = 21.3) from three drop-in centers in Los Angeles completed an in-person survey and social network interview between October 2011 and June 2013. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of youth based on nine types of substance use in the past 30 days; latent class logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with class membership. Results: Five polysubstance use classes were identified: heavy alcohol and marijuana (33.6 %), illicit drug use (4.9 %), high all polysubstance use (14.9 %), primarily marijuana (18.1 %), and low use (28.5 %). Relative to the low use class, traumatic experiences were associated with membership in every polysubstance use class. Suicide attempts were associated with membership in the high all class (OR = 9.41). Number of substance-using, homeless network members was associated with membership in the heavy alcohol and marijuana use class (OR = 1.35). Number of non-substance-using network members (homeless [OR = 0.29] and housed [OR = 0.73]) was associated with lower odds of membership in the high all class. Conclusions: Distinct groups of YEH can be identified by their recent polysubstance use patterns.

We sought to generate a comprehensive literature review that examines the complex relationship between tuberculosis and mental illness. Methods: A literature search was conducted in MedLine, Ovid and Psychinfo, with further examination of the references of these articles. In total 316 articles were identified. It was not possible to conduct a formal meta-analysis due to the absence of randomised controlled data. Results: Rates of mental illness of up to 70% have been identified in tuberculosis patients. Medications used in the treatment of common mental illnesses, such as depression, may have significant interactions with anti-tuberculosis agents, especially isoniazid and increasingly linezolid. Many medications used in the treatment of tuberculosis can have significant adverse psychiatric effects and some medications such as rifampicin may reduce the effective doses of anti-psychotics y their enzyme induction actions. Treatment with agents such as cycloserine has been associated with depression, and there have been reported cases of psychosis with most anti-tuberculous agents. Mental illness and substance abuse may also affect compliance with treatment, with attendant public health concerns. Conclusions: As a result of the common co-morbidity of mental illness and tuberculosis, it is probable that physicians will encounter previously undiagnosed mental illness among patients with tuberculosis. Similarly, psychiatrists are likely to meet tuberculosis among their patients.

Harris, Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom","Background: People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk of injection-related skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). If not treated promptly, these can lead to serious health complications, which are a considerable healthcare burden. Data from two community surveys, with different approaches, were used to assess SSTI prevalence and associated factors among PWID to inform intervention implementation. Methods: Data were analysed from two surveys, a national surveillance survey (n=2,874; 2017â€“18) of infections among PWID in the United Kingdom (UK) and an in-depth survey (n=455; 2018â€“19) of SSTI among PWID based in London, UK. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to ascertain the factors associated with self-reported SSTI. Results: High prevalence of SSTI were reported in both samples: 52 % of participants from the national surveillance survey reported having SSTI within the preceding 12 months and 65 % of the London sample reported a lifetime history of SSTI. The factors associated with SSTI in both surveys were similar, including older age; number of years injecting; number of attempts required to inject into the vein; injecting into the hands, feet, groin or neck and re-using or sharing needles/syringes. Conclusions: The number of PWID reporting SSTI in the UK is concerningly high. The two surveys used different recruitment approaches but found similar associations. We provide strong evidence of a relationship between venous access difficulty and SSTI. To stem the increase of SSTI and related complications in the UK, it is crucial that interventions attend to the underlying causes of venous damage among PWID.","L2006132649     2020-06-11     2020-07-02 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108080,cocaine;diamorphine;adult;age distribution;arm;article;female;foot;hand;health survey;hepatitis C;homelessness;human;Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence;inguinal region;injection drug user;injection site;leg;major clinical study;male;medical history;middle aged;neck;needle sharing;population research;prevalence;priority journal;risk assessment;risk factor;self report;skin infection;soft tissue infection;United Kingdom;vein;Great Britain,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Emergency department (ED) patients have disproportionate rates of both homelessness and substance use, yet little research has examined the overlap of these issues in the ED setting. We aimed to characterize alcohol and drug use in a sample of homeless vs. non-homeless ED patients. Methods: A random sample of urban hospital ED patients were invited to complete an interview regarding housing, substance use, and other health and social factors. We compared substance use characteristics among patients who did vs. did not report current literal (streets/shelter) homelessness. Additional analyses were performed using a broader definition of homelessness in the past 12-months. Results: Patients who were currently homeless (n = 316, 13.7%) versus non-homeless (n = 1,993, 86.3%) had higher rates of past year unhealthy alcohol use (44.4% vs. 30.5%, p <.0001), any drug use (40.8% vs. 18.8%, p <.0001), heroin use (16.7% vs. 3.8%, p <.0001), prescription opioid use (12.5% vs. 4.4%, p <.0001), and lifetime opioid overdose (15.8% vs. 3.7%, p <.0001). In multivariable analyses, current homelessness remained significantly associated with unhealthy alcohol use, AUDIT scores among unhealthy alcohol users, any drug use, heroin use, and opioid overdose; past 12-month homelessness was additionally associated with DAST-10 scores among drug users and prescription opioid use. Conclusions: Patients experiencing homelessness have higher rates and greater severity of alcohol and drug use than other ED patients across a range of measures. These findings have implications for planning services for patients with concurrent substance use and housing problems.","L2000804028     2018-06-04     2018-10-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Use (ED),Psychiatric health condition - Substance misuse | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.04.021,"diamorphine;opiate;adult;alcohol consumption;article;cohort analysis;correlational study;DAST 10 score;emergency ward;female;homelessness;human;intoxication;major clinical study;male;middle aged;prescription;priority journal;prospective study;risk factor;scoring system;substance use;urban area;Emergency Service, Hospital;Emergencies",,,N,N,Full text screen

To facilitate the exit out of homelessness, access to care and to improve psychosis and addiction outcomes, a new intensive outreach intervention team (EQIIP SOL) was created in Montreal (2012). It offers intensive outreach services dedicated to homeless youth suffering from first episode psychosis and addiction (HYFEPA) in addition to an early psychosis intervention service (EIS) in collaboration with the Addiction Psychiatry Unit. Our aim is to describe the characteristics, clinical, functional and housing outcomes of HYFEPA followed by EQIIP SOL. This two years long prospective longitudinal study with all HYFEPA (n = 42) admitted to EQIIP SOL between 2012â€“2015 reports at multiple time points, clinical (CGI, GAF), functional (SOFAS, work/study, housing autonomy) and substance use disorder (DUS, AUS) outcomes and acute services use (hospitalizations, emergency room visits). We observed that, at baseline, HYFEPA showed poor prognostic factors (eg. cluster B personality, substance use disorders, legal problems, childhood trauma and lower education level). The majority reached housing stability after 6 months and their functioning and illness severity improved with time. This suggests that HYFEPA improve with an intensive outreach intervention team integrated to an EIS.","L2001534698     2019-02-08     2019-02-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2019.01.076,adult;article;clinical article;clinical feature;disease association;disease severity;drug dependence;female;follow up;functional status;homeless youth;human;intervention study;longitudinal study;male;outcome assessment;priority journal;prognosis;prospective study;psychosis;risk factor;trend study;young adult;Psychotic Disorders;Adolescent;Substance-Related Disorders,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Dunleavy, School of Media, Culture and Society, University of the West of Scotland, Paisley, Scotland, United Kingdom","Background Bacterial skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are a health issue for people who inject drugs (PWID). There is a lack of evidence on the associations between harm reduction (HR) uptake and SSTIs. This paper examines the associations between the uptake of injecting equipment (IE) and opiate substitution treatment (OST) on SSTIs among PWID, and the injecting behaviours associated with having had an SSTI. This is the first large-scale, national study to examine the association between IE uptake and SSTIs. Methods A cross-sectional, voluntary and anonymous survey was undertaken with PWID recruited from pharmacies/agencies providing IE across mainland Scotland during 2013â€“2014. Participants were asked: if they had an SSTI within the past year; about their uptake of HR within the past 6 months (including needle/syringes (N/S), paraphernalia and OST); and about their frequency of injecting, sharing of IE and re-use of own N/S. Data from 1876 PWID who had reported injecting within the past 6 months were analysed. Findings In multivariate logistic regression, those with high combined IE-OST uptake (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.614, 95% CI 0.458â€“0.823, pÂ =Â 0.001) and medium combined IE-OST uptake (AOR 0.725, 95% CI 0.546â€“0.962, pÂ =Â 0.026) had lower odds of having had an SSTI compared to those with low combined IE-OST uptake. Conclusions IE and OST uptake may reduce the level of SSTIs among PWID, suggesting increasing combined uptake may be beneficial. Nevertheless, a sizeable proportion of PWID with high HR uptake experienced SSTIs, suggesting the importance of other interventions.","L614850668     2017-03-24     2017-04-07 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.01.020,methadone;adult;alcoholism;anonymised data;article;bacterial skin disease;cross-sectional study;disease association;female;harm reduction;heroin dependence;high risk behavior;homelessness;human;intravenous drug abuse;major clinical study;male;multiple drug abuse;needle;needle sharing;opiate addiction;opiate substitution treatment;correctional facility;recycling;Scotland;soft tissue infection;syringe,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Dunford, National Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","In 2015, an upsurge in acute HIV-1 subtype B infections was observed in Ireland among people who inject drugs, the majority of whom was homeless. The epidemiological investigation identified a significant association with injection of a new cathinone derivative, colloquially known as 'snow blow'. Concatenated HIV-1 polymerase and protease partial gene sequences (881 nucleotides; n=48) were aligned with all subtype B patient sequences analysed at the NVRL from 2000 to 2015 (n=918) and appropriate reference sequences using Bioedit v7.05. A neighbour-joining guide tree was constructed under a Kimura-2-Parameter model. Directed by this initial analysis, a maximum likelihood tree was constructed with a smaller number of more related Irish reference sequences (n=274) under a HKY model of evolution and a gamma distribution. Statistical support was provided by bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates. Trees were constructed using PAUPâˆ—software version 4.0 beta10 and Mega version 7. The sequences from cases under investigation clustered within larger transmission networks of Irish people who inject drugs. More refined phylogenetic analyses confirmed that 79 per cent of the cases fell into four distinct clusters; cluster 1 (n=16), cluster 2 (n=16), cluster 3 (n=3), and cluster 4 (n=3), with high bootstrap support for each cluster (>75 per cent). There were ten outliers which branched outside the four clusters. The phylogenetic analysis largely supported the epidemiological investigation and the majority of epidemiologically linked cases were found to be contained within the same genetic clusters. In addition, this analysis identified two further possible cases and also eliminated three more 'cases' from the outbreak. The present study highlighted the integral role that real-time phylogenetic analyses can play alongside extensive epidemiological investigations, assisting the clarification of epidemiological case definitions in temporal transmission network in a HIV outbreak investigation.","L623020681     2018-07-18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Conference Abstract,Infectious Diseases - HIV,Psychiatric health condition - Substance misuse | USER-NOTES: {""Carolyn""=>[""uptick in HIV infections associated with snow blow.

Additionally, the study sought to compare emergency room utilization among veterans and non-veterans. Methods: Secondary data analyses was conducted on male homeless veterans and non-veterans (N= 372) enrolled in the Alachua County Point in Time (PIT) study in Gainesville, FL. Participants were recruited at a homeless shelter and completed a questionnaire on demographics and health variables, including addictions, mental health, and physical health. Additional questions included recent emergency room visits and whether participants needed treatment services that they were not receiving. The use of this data was approved by the university institutional review board. Results: Homeless veterans were more likely to report problems with addictions compared to homeless non-veterans (AOR = 6.29, 95%CI: 3.43-11.53, p < .001). Veterans were also more likely to report mental health problems (AOR = 4.12, 95%CI: 2.43-6.53, p < .001) and physical problems (AOR = 1.83, 95%CI: 1.08-3.09, p < .01). Homeless veterans also had significantly greater odds than non-veterans of visiting a hospital emergency room in the past year (AOR = 1.73, 95%CI: 1.07-2.80, p < .05). Conclusions: While much is known about the susceptibility of veterans for addiction and other health problems, our results reveal that over half of homeless veterans are presenting to hospital emergency rooms.

The peak incidence in children is 7-10 years old and can present with a variety of clinical scenarios. Our aim is to describe the clinical presentation, management and outcome to date of a now 5 year old boy who was diagnosed with Moya Moya at 22 months of age. Methods: We report the presenting features, examinations findings and results of radiological images and laboratory investigations, treatment and natural history with regard to our now school age patient. Results: A 22 month old boy presented to the ED following a fall to one side and an episode of high pitched crying. He was afebrile with no recent temperatures or illnesses. His history was notable for a previous afebrile seizure at five months of age lasting over one hour, and recent concerns regarding developmental delay. He had previously had a normal MRI and CT brain, and a normal EEG. The seizure was eventually controlled on phenobarbitone, and an urgent CT brain showed frontal lobe ischaemia with chronic infarct in the left parietal lobe. He was transferred to Temple St Hospital and subsequently diagnosed with moyamoya. He attended Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital for several revascularisation surgeries. He was diagnosed with autism and a sensory processing disorder, and is fed via a gastrostomy tube. He is now five years old, and has been seizure free for several years. He is ambulant, with over 100 words and good comprehension.

Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 303 HIV-infected opioid-dependent patients initiating buprenorphine/naloxone treatment. Outcomes included self-reported past 90-day needle-sharing and non-condom use. We assessed trends over the 12 months using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Using generalized estimating equations, after multiple imputation, we determined factors independently associated with needle-sharing and non-condom use, including time-updated variables. We then conducted a mediation analysis to determine whether substance use explained the relationship between time since treatment initiation and needle-sharing. Results: Needle-sharing decreased from baseline to the fourth quarter following initiation of buprenorphine/naloxone (9% vs. 3%, p < 0.001), while non-condom use did not (23% vs. 21%, p = 0.10). HIV risk behaviors did not vary based on the presence of a detectable HIV-1 RNA viral load. Patients who were homeless and used heroin, cocaine/amphetamines or marijuana were more likely to report needle-sharing. Heroin use fully mediated the relationship between time since treatment initiation and needle-sharing. Women, patients who identified as being gay/lesbian/bisexual, those married or living with a partner and who reported heroin or alcohol use were more likely to report non-condom use. Older patients were less likely to report non-condom use. Conclusions: While buprenorphine/naloxone is associated with decreased needle-sharing among HIV-infected opioid-dependent patients, sexual risk behaviors persist regardless of viral load. Targeted interventions to address HIV risk behaviors among HIV-infected opioid-dependent populations receiving buprenorphine/naloxone are needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ellis, Washington University in St. Louis, Box 8134, 660S, Euclid Ave., St. Louis, MO, United States","Background: As prescriptions for gabapentin have increased in recent years, nonmedical use and risk of adverse outcomes (e.g., hospitalizations and overdose) have been identified, particularly in association with opioids, including opioid agonist medications (OAMs) buprenorphine and methadone. However, there is a lack of systematic, nationwide data assessing the relationship between the nonmedical use of gabapentin and OAMs. Methods: Data were sourced from two nationwide opioid surveillance programs of treatment-seeking individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Both programs utilized an identical serial, cross sectional survey of 12,792 new entrants to one of 163 substance use treatment programs for OUD in 46 states and the District of Columbia from January 2019 to December 2020. Results: Past month nonmedical use of gabapentin was endorsed by 9.3% of the sample. Of those using gabapentin nonmedically, 64.1% also endorsed nonmedical use of an OAM, including concomitant use of methadone (35.3%), and buprenorphine (49.0%). Concomitant nonmedical use of gabapentin and OAMs was more prevalent (versus nonmedical use of gabapentin alone) in the Southern region, among those living in a street dwelling, those with chronic pain and healthcare professionals. Conclusions: Nonmedical use of gabapentin in people with OUD appears to frequently coincide with nonmedical use of OAMs. As prescriptions and off-label use of gabapentin increase, provider education should include the risks of concomitant gabapentin and OAM use, particularly amongst buprenorphine prescribers. Future research should investigate motivations (e.g., OUD self-management) for nonmedical use of gabapentin and OAMs within the context of OUD treatment access and retention.","L2017213183     2022-03-17     2022-03-25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109400,"buprenorphine;gabapentin;methadone;opiate agonist;adult;article;chronic pain;Colombia;combination drug therapy;community dwelling person;controlled study;cross-sectional study;demography;female;health care personnel;health survey;help seeking behavior;homeless person;human;male;medical education;middle aged;monotherapy;motivation;opiate addiction;prescription drug misuse;risk assessment;self care;young adult;Analgesics, Opioid",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Our aim was to estimate the costs of crime associated with different forms and intensities of stimulant use. Methods Retrospective cohort study, including individuals from three prospective cohorts in Vancouver, Canada, measured biannually (2011â€“2015), reporting stimulant use at baseline assessment. Monthly crime costs included policing, court, corrections, and criminal victimization (2016 CAD). We estimated monthly crime costs associated with mutually exclusive categories of crack, cocaine, methamphetamine, and polystimulant use, stratified by daily/non-daily use, relative to stimulant abstinence, as well as the independent effects of treatment (opioid agonist (OAT) and other addiction treatment). We used a two-part model, capturing the probability of criminal activity and costs of crime with generalized linear logistic and gamma regression models, respectively, controlling for age, gender, education, homelessness, mental health issues, employment, prior incarceration, alcohol and opioid use. Results The study sample included 1599 individuals (median age 39, 65.9% male) assessed over 5299 biannual interviews. Estimates of associated monthly crime costs ranged from $5449 [95% C.I.: $2180, $8719] for non-daily polystimulant use, to $8893 [$4196, $13,589] for daily polystimulant use. Cost differences between daily/non-daily use, injection/non-injection, and stimulant type were not statistically significant. Drug treatment was not associated with lower monthly crime costs in our sample. Conclusions Substantial crime-related costs were associated with stimulant use, emphasizing the urgency for development and implementation of efficacious treatment regimens.","L618915576     2017-10-30     2017-11-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.08.026,central stimulant agent;cocaine;methamphetamine;opiate agonist;abstinence;adult;age;alcohol consumption;article;Canadian;cohort analysis;cost;court;crime;drug dependence treatment;educational status;employment;female;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;mental disease;policy;priority journal;correctional facility;retrospective study;sex difference;substance use;victim;Crime,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

We describe the prevalence and risk factors for HBV and HCV infections and use of an opt-out hepatitis testing and integrated linkage to care pathway in a London Emergency Department (ED). ED patients aged >= 16 years having routine blood tests from 15 February-28 March 2016 were tested for hepatitis, unless opted out. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody tests (HCV-Ab, including a confirmatory hepatitis C antigen test (HCV-Ag)) were pre-selected on electronic blood test requests. Linkage to care (attending one clinic appointment) was offered to HBsAg and HCV-Ag patients (new or known-disengaged with care diagnoses). Weighted prevalence estimates and risk factors for seropositivity adjusted by demographics and survey weights were calculated using logistic regression. Hepatitis testing uptake was 56% (3,290/5,865). Overall, 26 HBsAg (10 new diagnoses) and 63 HCV-Ab patients were identified of which 32 were HCV-Ag positive (10 new diagnoses). Weighted seroprevalence of HBsAg was 0.50% (95% CI 0.3-0.8%); HCV-Ab 2.0% (95% CI 1.5-2.7%) and HCV-Ag 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.7%). Risk factors for infection were being male (HBsAg: aOR 4.1, 95% CI 1.5-11.3), of non-White British ethnicity (HBsAg: aOR>11) or being homeless (HCV-Ag: aOR 18.9, 95% CI 6.9-51.4). We achieved a high linkage to care uptake for HBsAg (93%) and HCV-Ag (78%) among patients who were contacted and required linkage. A pre-selected hepatitis testing ordering system facilitated a high testing uptake. New and disengaged with care diagnoses and a high HCV prevalence were identified demonstrating the potential to identify and link patients to care in this setting. Strategies connecting clinical care with community outreach services are key for improving patient linkage to care.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 13 Total Times Cited: 13 Cited Reference Count: 37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0198520,"C VIRUS-INFECTION;LIVER-DISEASE;ENGLAND;PREVALENCE;ETHNICITY;Emergency Service, Hospital;Emergencies",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Evans-Brown, European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addicition (EMCDDA), Lisbon, Portugal","In the mid-2000s, rumors spread of a new 'herbal high' called Spice which when smoked gave a strong cannabis-like effect. By the end of 2008, European investigators found that the plant material was laced with highly potent synthetic cannabinoids. Since then, 169 cannabinoids have been identified on Europe's drug market-including 11 in 2016-making them the largest group of substances monitored by the EU Early Warning System. These cannabinoids have been used to create hundreds of different products sold as 'legal' replacements for cannabis. In 2015, more than 24,000 seizures weighing 2.3 ton were made by law enforcement. Bulk powders made in China and capable of producing millions of doses made up 20% of the seizures, including: 5F-AMB (61 kg), 5F-AKB48 (61 kg) and ADB-FUBINACA(57 kg). Synthetic cannabinoids share some pharmacological similarities with (-)-trans-A9-tetrahydrocannabinol; however many are super-agonists at the CB1 receptor; little else is known about most of them, including their effects on other targets. More cannabinoids has meant more toxicity-e.g. >28 MDMB-CHMICA-related deaths in Europe. These products have also caused mass poisonings. Their use by vulnerable groups such as the homeless and prisoners is increasing. The harms are fuelled by the high potency of the substances and poor manufacturing processes. This leads to highly concentrated amounts of the substance-'hot pockets'-leading to higher doses and increased risk of poisoning and death. I'm going to discuss these challenges and share our experiences of the central role toxicovigilance plays in identifying and understanding the observed harms.","L623051777     2018-07-20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1016/j.toxlet.2017.07.179,cannabinoid 1 receptor;cannabis;endogenous compound;agonist;China;conference abstract;controlled study;death;drug megadose;drug therapy;drug toxicity;Europe;human;intoxication;law enforcement;major clinical study;nonhuman;powder;prisoner;seizure;side effect;Cannabinoids,,,N,N,Full text screen

Homeless adults have greater physical and mental health needs and elevated levels of acute and chronic disease( 2). Although malnutrition and wasting have been reported in the homeless(3), the specific nutritional issues faced by each homeless community remain unclear. Food availability is a major problem for street homeless individuals and whilst some hostels provide meals, these may not adhere to national dietary recommendations. The aim of this study was to compare the dietary intake, nutritional status and wellbeing of street homeless and hostel residents in Reading (UK). Street homeless (n 24) and hostel residents (n 52) were recruited from the Reading region. Dietary intake was determined using the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Norfolk Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The Patient Health Questionnaire: Somatic Anxiety Depressive Symptoms (PHQ-SADS) assessed for signs indicative of mental illness. Demographic, behavioural and physiological information was collected using closed-ended questions and anthropometric measurements. General linear models were adjusted for age, gender and ethnicity. Street homeless and hostel residents were aged 38 (SD 10Â·4) and 38 (SD 10Â·5) years with a body mass index of 23 kg/m2 and 25 kg/m2 respectively (P=0Â·371) Reported intakes of saturated fat (SFA) (15Â·0 %TE vs. 13Â·6 %TE, P=0Â·039), milk (449 g vs. 229 g, P=0Â·005) and potato (107 g vs. 63 g, P=0Â·021) were all significantly higher in hostel residents compared with street homeless, although street homeless individuals had a higher intake of soups and sauces (83 g vs. 48 g, P=0Â·002). Additionally, daily intakes of SFA exceeded, and non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) (13Â·4 g, SD 7Â·9) and fruit and vegetables (Fâ‰ˆV) (3Â·7 portions) failed to meet government recommendations and that reported in the general population (12Â·6 % SFA, 13Â·7 g NSP, 4Â·1 portionsF&V)(4).

Participants (N = 103)with serious psychiatric disorders (SPD; global assessment of functioning scores below 50)were recruited within 60 days of scheduled release from prison, and provided pre-release and six monthly follow-up interviews. Seventy eight percent of the released sample had at least one follow-up contact. Baseline interviews revealed low social stability prior to the current term of incarceration, and forty five percent of the sample had been returned to jail or prison within six months of release. Regression models revealed that perceived psychiatric stigma was a significant (negative)predictor of medication adherence in the community and even in prison. A path analysis showed that perceived stigma predicted responses on the K-6 psychological distress measure and recidivism both directly and indirectly via its influence on medication adherence.

Farina, RCSI, Ireland","Introduction: In Temple Street Children's University Hospital, we care for more than 150,000 children per year, leading to the Phlebotomy Department receiving numerous blood forms each day. Blood form requests are an essential component of patient care. They must contain the proper information in order for the specimen to be processed. There is raised concern regarding multiple forms not being correctly completed. This leads to unnecessary added workload for both phlebotomists and medical team members. In some occasions, it leads to unnecessary repeat courses of venepuncture on a child. Purpose: To raise awareness among medical staff regarding the importance of accuracy in filling out blood form requests. To evaluate the current performance compared to predefined criteria set by the Irish local Health Department. To implement the use of the plan, do, study, act (PDSA) model to improve the current situation in our hospital. Methods: This is a 4-week prospective study during which data are collected on a daily basis to evaluate the current performance of accuracy. During the end of the second week, data were evaluated and action was taken. A medical student made a verbal announcement during Grand Rounds, creating awareness on this audit and highlighting the most commonly omitted components on the blood forms for the previous 2 weeks. Reminders were sent out to medical doctors from all specialties on group chats to inform those who may have been absent at Grand Rounds. Data were again evaluated during the fourth week. All data were anonymised, collated and analysed on Excel. Results: During the 4 weeks period, a total of 238 venipunctures were performed. During the first 2 weeks, 38/116 (32.65%) forms were not filled out correctly. During the 3rd and 4th week, post verbal action taken, there was a total of 39/122 (31.65%) forms not filled out correctly. The two most commonly omitted components were biography sticker details on the forms and adequate number of stickers for blood bottle samples. Conclusion: Despite action being taken, there has been no improvement. Leaving out biography sticker details on forms and not putting sufficient stickers for blood bottle samples are serious omissions. During the next PDSA cycle, we plan to design screen savers for hospital computers to create a stronger visual prompt, as well as a laminated card-size checklist reminder to be distributed to all medical staff.","L625688243     2019-01-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1080/2331205X.2018.1544190,awareness;checklist;child;computer;conference abstract;female;homeless youth;human;literature;major clinical study;male;medical staff;medical student;patient care;phlebotomist;phlebotomy;physician;prospective study;public health service;university hospital;vein puncture;workload,,,N,N,Full text screen

The causes of homelessness are an interaction between individual and structural factors. Individual factors include poverty, family problems, and mental health and substance misuse problems. The availability of low-cost housing is thought to be the most important structural determinant for homelessness. Homeless people have higher rates of premature mortality than the rest of the population, especially from suicide and unintentional injuries, and an increased prevalence of a range of infectious diseases, mental disorders, and substance misuse. High rates of non-communicable diseases have also been described with evidence of accelerated ageing. Although engagement with health services and adherence to treatments is often compromised, homeless people typically attend the emergency department more often than non-homeless people. We discuss several recommendations to improve the surveillance of morbidity and mortality in homeless people. Programmes focused on high-risk groups, such as individuals leaving prisons, psychiatric hospitals, and the child welfare system, and the introduction of national and state-wide plans that target homeless people are likely to improve outcomes.

METHODS: All admissions to psychiatry units in two university hospitals in Ireland were studied over a 3.5-year period. RESULTS: Of 2,715 admissions, 443 (16%) were involuntary; complete data were available for 390 of these involuntary admissions, of which 78 (20%) involved police. Patients with police involvement did not differ significantly from those without police involvement in gender, marital and employment status, or diagnosis. The former patients had a longer mean admission duration and were more likely to be admitted under the ""risk criterion"" of the Mental Health Act 2001. Multivariable testing indicated that these variables do not independently predict police involvement. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic or demographic factors examined did not contribute to police involvement in involuntary admission.

However, little is known about the differential impact of distinct traumatic events and the role of general symptoms in mediating this relationship. Thus, our study aimed to explore the differential association of several traumatic events to the psychotic symptoms in a sample of prisoners and whether this association is mediated by general symptoms. The total sample from the Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity Among Prisoners in England and Wales (N = 3039; 75.4% male) was used. Participants completed a list of traumatic events experienced before reclusion, the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire, Clinical Review Schedule-Revised. Network analysis was used to estimate the network of interactions between traumatic events and general and psychotic symptoms. Shortest paths analysis was performed to identify the different development trajectories. Results suggested that memory problems, compulsions, and irritability might be key mediating symptoms for most traumatic events. However, sexual abuse showed alternative mediators that might be specific of this traumatic event. Finally, the traumatic events, suffered from violence at work, separation/divorce and been homeless showed direct associations with specific psychotic symptoms.","L2005136501     2020-03-16     2020-03-24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112894,adolescent;adult;aged;article;compulsion;disease association;divorce;England;exposure to violence;female;homelessness;human;irritability;life event;major clinical study;male;memory disorder;middle aged;morbidity;pathogenesis;population research;posttraumatic stress disorder;priority journal;correctional facility;psychosis;sexual abuse;Wales;young adult;Prisons;Prisoners,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Method: Three-group, single blind, randomized controlled trial in a Level 1Trauma Center enrolled 395 admitted patients with drug positive toxicology screen or verbal report of drug use in the previous 30 days. 34% were Hispanic, 45% non-Hispanic White, 16% non-Hispanic Black. 88% smoked marijuana, 28% used cocaine and 11% prescription opioids. Brief Advice (BA) provided advice to abstain from drugs, educational materials and referral to community resources. Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI) additionally included a 30-45 minute session, with assessment feedback, based on motivational interviewing. BMI + B included a telephone booster 4-weeks post-intervention. Drug use as measured by percent days abstinent and total abstinence, derived from the Timeline Follow back was the primary outcome. Results: A significant reduction from baseline was observed at 3, 6, and 12 months in the primary outcomes of any drug use (excluding alcohol); cannabis and cocaine, the most frequently used drugs, were analyzed individually. There were no between group differences or group X time interactions. Similarly, there were no between groups differences on secondary outcomes including perceived health status, re-injury, arrest, incarceration, alcohol and drug treatment, employment, AA attendance, homelessness, physical abuse, and problems associated with alcohol and drug use. Conclusions: The study does not support use of these enhanced motivational interventions over brief advice for trauma patients with a positive screen for drug use.","L2004816552     2020-02-05     2020-02-11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107792,telephone;alcohol;cannabis;cocaine;methamphetamine;opiate;prescription drug;sedative agent;abstinence;accident prevention;adult;African American;article;brief advice;brief motivational intervention;clinical outcome;community care;controlled study;detention;disease association;drug abuse;drug therapy;emergency health service;employment;European American;female;health status;Hispanic;homelessness;hospital patient;human;injury;intermethod comparison;interview;major clinical study;male;motivation;patient attendance;patient counseling;patient education;patient referral;physical abuse;priority journal;psychologic assessment;screening;self concept;single blind procedure;Texas;tobacco;toxicology;urban area;Trauma Centers;Substance-Related Disorders,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: We analyzed data from 5592 adult (â‰¥18 years old) respondents to the 2014 Health Center Patient Survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of individuals who receive care at U.S. Federally Qualified Health Centers. We evaluated self-reported smoking status, smoking-related quit behaviors (having quit, wanting or attempting to quit in the past year, and planning to quit in the next 6 months), and receipt of advice to quit smoking among participants with and without alcohol use disorder (AUD) and drug use disorder (DUD). Results: Current smoking was common among individuals with AUD (64.3%) and DUD (55.0%). Few patients with AUD or DUD had quit smoking (16.7% and 24.0%, respectively). Smokers with AUD had higher odds of wanting to quit smoking in the past year (adjusted odds ratio = 2.88; 95% confidence interval = 1.19, 7.05), but were not more likely to have made a past-year quit attempt. DUD was not significantly associated with smoking-related quit behaviors. Smokers with AUD or DUD, as well as those who engaged in treatment for AUD or DUD, did not differ significantly from other smokers in receipt of advice to quit smoking. Conclusions: Smokers with AUD and DUD were unlikely to have quit smoking despite interest in quitting. Our findings suggest a need for individualized tobacco treatment approaches in patients with AUD and DUD and missed opportunities to provide tobacco cessation counseling during addiction treatment.","L2002213922     2019-07-08     2019-07-11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.05.004,amphetamine;cannabis;cocaine;opiate;psychedelic agent;adult;alcoholism;article;cannabis use;counseling;cross-sectional study;disease association;drug dependence;female;health behavior;health care planning;health center;human;male;priority journal;smoking cessation;Smoke;Substance-Related Disorders;Health Behavior,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

The current study examines receipt of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder among veterans with a history of justice involvement at U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities compared to veterans with no justice involvement. Methods: Using national VHA clinical and pharmacy records, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of veterans with an opioid use disorder diagnosis in fiscal year 2012. Using a mixed-effects logistic regression model, we examined receipt of pharmacotherapy in the 1-year period following diagnosis as a function of justice involvement, adjusting for patient and facility characteristics. Results: The 1-year rate of receipt for pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder was 27% for prison involved veterans, 34% for jail/court-involved veterans, and 33% for veterans not justice-involved. Compared to veterans not justice-involved, those prison-involved had 0.75 lower adjusted odds (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.87) of receiving pharmacotherapy whereas jail/court-involved veterans did not have significantly different adjusted odds. Conclusions: Targeted efforts to improve receipt of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder among veterans exiting prison is needed as they have lower odds of receiving these medications.

The authors set out to identify the psychological status of asylum-seeking children and highlight their needs. A search of three electronic databases was carried out, resulting in 15 studies. Data show that asylum-seeking children appear to experience many mental health difficulties, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, self-harm, sleep disturbance and behavioural difficulties. The daily living situation includes a range of psychological stressors, such as lack of space and control; fear of deportation; feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness; poor parental mental health; lack of recreational facilities; communication issues; and financial worries. Since many asylum-seeking children have experienced past trauma, hospitalisation and healthcare encounters may trigger traumatic memories and cause further distress. Awareness of the psychological impact of the situation on children and families may help nurses to provide empathetic, sensitive and culturally competent care.

Economic burden estimates that describe the impact of the crisis are needed when considering federal and state resources devoted to addressing overdoses. In this study, we estimate the societal costs for opioid use disorder and fatal overdose from all opioids in 2017. Methods: We estimated costs of fatal overdose from all opioids and opioid use disorder based on the incidence of overdose deaths and the prevalence of past-year opioid use disorder for 2017. Incidence of fatal opioid overdose was obtained from the National Vital Statistics System; prevalence of past-year opioid use disorder was estimated from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Costs were estimated for health care, criminal justice and lost productivity. Costs for the reduced quality of life for opioid use disorder and life lost due to fatal opioid overdose were valued using U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for valuing reductions in morbidity and mortality. Results: Costs for opioid use disorder and fatal opioid overdose in 2017 were estimated to be $1.02 trillion. The majority of the economic burden is due to reduced quality of life from opioid use disorder and the value of life lost due to fatal opioid overdose. Conclusions: These estimates can assist decision makers in understanding the magnitude of opioid use disorder and fatal overdose. Knowing the magnitude and distribution of the economic burden can inform public policy, clinical practice, research, and prevention and response activities.","L2008403928     2020-11-03 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108350,"adult;article;clinical practice;controlled study;criminal justice;disease burden;economic aspect;economic development;female;health care cost;health care need;health care policy;health insurance;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;medicaid;medicare;opiate addiction;opiate overdose;population research;practice guideline;priority journal;productivity;quality of life;United States;Analgesics, Opioid",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Many agencies work in silos due to pressure and focus of workload. From An acute medical social work perspective there was an awareness that sensitive information about clients was being managed through referral forms and bureaucratic processes. It was felt that clients interests would be best serviced by a sharing of information, resources and ideas in a less formal more personal manner. A structured series of meetings and seminars on topics of shared interests was carried out between acute hospitals and social workers in primary and secondary health services. A clarification of agency roles and services emerged. We produced a resource directory and a contact list of social workers in HSE CHO area 9. We held seminars and workshops on a variety of topics including: interagency working with chronically challenging clients; managing homelessness; and promoting excellence in practice. We conducted a survey of participants highlighting the benefits of getting to know each other personally and developing closer links between services to develop integrated care pathways for service users.

Bruneau, CHUM Research Centre (CRCHUM), 900 Rue Saint-Denis, MontrÃ©al, QC, Canada","Background: The relationship between housing stability and drug injecting is complex, as both outcomes fluctuate over time. The objectives were to identify short-term trajectories of housing stability and injecting frequency among people who inject drugs (PWID) and examine how patterns of injecting frequency relate to those of housing stability. Methods: At three-month intervals, PWID enrolled between 2011 and 2016 in the Hepatitis Cohort completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire and were tested for hepatitis C and HIV infections. At each visit, participants reported, for each of the past three months, the accommodation they lived in the longest (stable/unstable) and the number of injecting days (0â€“30). Group-based dual trajectory modeling was conducted to identify housing stability and injecting frequency trajectories evolving concomitantly over 12 months and estimate the probabilities of following injecting trajectories conditional upon housing trajectories. Results: 386 participants were included (mean age 40.0, 82 % male). Three housing stability trajectories were identified: sustained (53 %), declining (20 %), and improving (27 %). Five injecting frequency trajectories were identified: sporadic (26 %), infrequent (34 %), increasing (15 %), decreasing (11 %), and frequent (13 %). PWID with improving housing were less likely to increase injecting (8 %) compared to those with sustained (17 %) or declining housing (17 %). Conclusions: Improving housing was associated with a lower probability of increasing injecting compared to declining housing, while sustained housing stability was associated with a higher probability of increasing injecting compared to improving housing. Therefore, policies to improve PWID's access to stable housing are warranted and may reduce, to some extent, drug injecting and related harms.","L2003971555     2019-12-02     2019-12-04 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107744,adult;article;Canada;cohort analysis;controlled study;disease assessment;drug use;female;follow up;hepatitis C;housing;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;infection risk;injection;injection drug user;interview;longitudinal study;male;priority journal;questionnaire;sex difference,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Frazer, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 733 North Broadway, Baltimore, MD, United States","Background: Pregnancy is a unique opportunity to provide broad and necessary medical care for women- including treatment for Substance Use Disorders (SUD). The standard of care for SUD in pregnant women is treatment at a comprehensive care facility. There is little existing qualitative research exploring what brings pregnant women with SUD to treatment and what barriers to treatment exist for this population. This study explored women's self-reported reasons for pursuing treatment or hesitating to do so. Methods: This qualitative study used interviews to explore common factors that motivate pregnant women with SUD to seek comprehensive care during pregnancy and common hesitations/ barriers to treatment. The study population included 20 women in treatment at a comprehensive care facility for pregnant and parenting women at Johns Hopkins. Participants volunteered to do interviews which were recorded and transcribed for analysis. Results: Interviews revealed several major themes in motivators to seek treatment: readiness to stop using, concern for the baby's health, concern about custody of the baby or other children, wanting to escape violent environments or homelessness, and seeking structure. Barriers to treatment included fear of loss of custody, not wanting to be away from children/partner, concern about stigma or privacy, and lack of childcare and transportation. Conclusions: This study revealed common motivators to seek treatment and barriers to treatment for pregnant women with SUD. These themes may help direct future studies and guide efforts to increase access to crucial care in this vulnerable population.","L2003663977     2019-11-12     2019-11-14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107652,adult;article;drug dependence;female;gestational age;help seeking behavior;human;major clinical study;motivation;pregnant woman;prescription drug misuse;priority journal;qualitative research;risk factor;self report;smoking;Substance-Related Disorders,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Yet, substance use disorders treatment (tx) history of HIV-SUs not enrolled in HIV care is not well understood.Wemeasured factors associated with tx history among HIV-SUs. Methods: This analysis included 801 HIV-SUs from the baseline assessment of the NIDA Clinical Trials Network 0049 study, a RCT designed to help HIV-SUs recruited from hospital settings achieve viral suppression. We examined associations between substance use, health status and tx history. Results: In the last year, 20% used opioids, 64% used stimulants, 18% injected drugs, and 49% were heavy alcohol users. Overall, 55% had ever participated in tx; of these, 36% participated in tx in the last year. Ever participated in tx was associated with likely depression and taking HIV medication. Likelihood of tx in the last year was higher among those with unstable housing or those who reported substance use-related discrimination. Conclusions: Structural barriers (unstable housing) and possible motivators of tx participation (likely depression) were related to substance use disorder tx history. The association between discrimination and txmaypromote the development of targeted strategies. Discrimination may lead to tx initiation or, alternatively tx experience may increase perceptions of discrimination. Similarly, taking HIV medication may prospectively be associated with better outcomes of intervention. The factors uncovered in the current analysis point to potential modifiers of Project Hope.","L72176590     2016-02-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.07.1121,alcohol;central stimulant agent;substance abuse;United States;therapy;college;drug dependence;city;Human immunodeficiency virus;substance use;drug therapy;housing;hospital;clinical trial (topic);health status;hope;HIV Infections;Substance-Related Disorders,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

In this study, we compare the effects of methamphetamine use versus other drugs on viremia in sexual minority men on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: HIV-positive participants currently on ART (N = 230) were selected from an ongoing cohort of diverse young sexual minority men (mSTUDY) enrolled from August 2014 to May 2018. Substance use and sociodemographic factors associated with viremia outcomes were assessed using ordinal regression analysis with generalized estimating equations. Viremia outcomes were grouped as undetectable (<20 copies/mL), low level suppressed (21â€“200 copies/mL), or not suppressed (>200 copies/mL). Results: The prevalence of drug use across 825 study visits was 73 %, with methamphetamine use most prevalent (50 %). After adjusting for unstable housing and ART adherence, methamphetamine use, either alone (adjusted OR = 1.87; 95 % CI 1.03âˆ’3.40) or with other drugs (adjusted OR = 1.82; 95 % CI 1.12âˆ’2.95), was associated with higher odds of increasing viremia compared to no drug use. Other drug use excluding methamphetamine did not show a similar association (adjusted OR = 1.29; 95 % CI 0.80âˆ’2.09). Among our study population, nearly half the instances of viremia could be reduced if methamphetamine was discontinued (attributable fraction = 46 %; 95 % CI 3â€“71 %). Conclusions: Methamphetamine use, either alone or in combination with other drugs, is associated with failure of viral suppression among sexual minority men on ART independent of adherence and sociodemographic factors. This accounts for nearly half of the observed instances of unsuppressed viremia in this study.","L2011102374     2021-03-02     2021-07-20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108622,antiretrovirus agent;illicit drug;methamphetamine;adult;antiretroviral therapy;article;clinical outcome;cohort analysis;comparative study;controlled study;demography;high risk population;housing;human;human cell;Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection;Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient;major clinical study;male;men who have sex with men;outcome assessment;patient compliance;prevalence;regression analysis;sexual and gender minority;substance use;viremia;virus inhibition;Methamphetamine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

These features of homeless services directly influence providers, their work performance and the clients' outcomes. The present research, conducted in eight European countries, investigated how social providers working in HF or TS (Traditional Staircase) describe and conceptualize the goals and the principles of their services. Data were collected through 29 focus group discussions involving 121 providers. The results showed that HF and TS had similar and different goals for their clients in the following areas: support, social integration, satisfaction of needs, housing, and well-being. HF providers emphasized clients' autonomy and ability to determine their personal goals, with housing being considered a start on the path of recovery, while TS were more focused on individual clients' basic needs with respect to food, health and finding temporary accommodations. HF providers privileged the person-centered approach and housing as a right, while TS providers were more focused on helping everyone. Implications of the results are discussed as suggestions both for practice and for research.","1660-4601     Gaboardi, Marta     Orcid: 0000-0003-2263-1359     Lenzi, Michela     Disperati, Francesca     Santinello, Massimo     Vieno, Alessio     Tinland, AurÃ©lie     Vargas-Moniz, Maria J     Orcid: 0000-0002-4875-9118     Spinnewijn, Freek     O'Shaughnessy, Branagh R     Orcid: 0000-0003-4417-7273     Wolf, Judith R     Bokszczanin, Anna     Bernad, Roberto     Beijer, Ulla     Ornelas, JosÃ©     Orcid: 0000-0002-8972-7518     Shinn, Marybeth     Consortium Study Group, Home-Eu     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Switzerland     Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019 May 7;16(9):1590. doi: 10.3390/ijerph16091590. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.3390/ijerph16091590,Europe;Female;Focus Groups;*Homeless Persons;Housing;Humans;Male;cross-national study;goals;homelessness;housing first;principles;providers;service delivery,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

NÃ­ Cheallaigh et al (2017) reported a high burden of disease in socially excluded individuals in Ireland that can be effectively addressed by dedicated service planning and care provision. VTE in socially excluded persons has been identified by our group as a key knowledge gap. We have generated preliminary data demonstrating that socially excluded people account for a significant proportion of patients presenting with VTE in Dublin. Methods We extracted national Hospital InPatient Enquiry (HIPE) data from Health Atlas Ireland using the methods outlined in Kevane et al (2019). We identified individuals as â€œsocially excluded personsâ€ if their records contained one or more of the variables identified by Aldridge et al (2018): homeless individuals, prisoners, sex workers and individuals with substance use disorders. We identified all emergency inpatient hospital admissions for those with any diagnosis of VTE during 2017 using VTE-associated ICD-10 codes. Results There were 494,972 emergency inpatient admissions in patients >16 years during this 12 month period, of which 5,717 (1.2%) had a VTE diagnosis (55% of which were DVTs). 306 (5.3%) of hospital episodes with VTE occurred in socially excluded individuals. Applying maximum and minimum assumptions on the estimated population denominator we estimated that overall the annual incidence rate of VTE-related hospitalisation per person was approximately 10-fold higher in socially excluded individuals when compared to the general population (in which it was 0.12%). Conclusions This is the first time that an approximately ten-fold increase in the risk of hospitalisation due to VTE has been shown to be associated with social exclusion. This information was generated from national data, using surrogate identifiers for socially excluded persons. We hypothesise that detailed characterisation of VTE events in socially excluded clients will permit improved service planning and care provision for these vulnerable patients, enabling better VTE prevention and management. This may save lives and prevent the disabling and common long-term consequence of post-thrombotic syndrome with debilitating leg ulcers, which in this population results in numerous admissions and severe mobility issues. Planning such initiatives has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality, improve quality of life but also to reduce hospital admissions (which are hugely over-represented in this patient group), save costs and resources and most importantly results in more equitable health care for socially excluded patients.

Gabrielian, VAGLA, Los Angeles, CA, United States","Aims: Homeless Veterans have high rates of mental illness and substance use. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-VA Supportive Housing (VASH) program (a Housing First effort) is central to VA efforts to serve this population. Yet, little is known about healthcare utilization patterns associated with achieving VASH housing. We compared VA Greater Los Angeles (VAGLA) service use among: (1) formerly homeless Veterans housed in VASH (VASH Veterans, n = 1997); (2) currently homeless Veterans (n = 1760); (3) housed, low-income Veterans not in VASH (n = 21,682); and (4) housed, not low-income Veterans (n = 37,020) who received care from 10/1/2010-9/30/2011. Methods: Using administrative data, we compared the four groups' medical/surgical and mental health/addiction service use (inpatient, outpatient, and Emergency Department (ED)). We controlled for demographics, need, and primary care access in regression analyses of utilization data. Results: VASH Veterans received more inpatient, outpatient, and ED care than currently homeless; housed, low-income; and housed, not low-income Veterans. Marked differences were seen in outpatient mental health/addiction (mean 11/7/2/2 visits/yr) and opioid maintenance clinics (mean 4/1/1/1 visits/yr). Adjusting for demographics and need, VASH Veterans and the currently homeless were more likely to have an outpatient mental health/addiction visit (AOR = 10.2/6.4, p < .05, with the housed, not low-income as a reference group). Adjusting first for demographics and need (model 1), then also for primary care use (model 2), HUD-VASH Veterans had the greatest decrease in incident rates outpatient mental health/addiction from models 1 to 2, becoming similar to the currently homeless (IRR 2.4/2.0, p < .05), compared to the housed, not low-income group. Conclusions: Currently homeless Veterans use fewer mental health/addiction services than VASH Veterans, but both groups receive more mental health/addiction care than their housed peers. VASH may enable needed service use for homeless Veterans, through links to housing and primary care.","L71802226     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.241,opiate;lowest income group;veteran;human;United States;housing;college;drug dependence;health care utilization;outpatient;model;primary medical care;hospital patient;population;substance use;regression analysis;hospital;emergency ward;mental disease;Health Services,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

DeBeck, B.C Centre on Substance Use, anada 1045 Howe Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Objectives: Childhood trauma is common among street-involved youth and is associated with injection drug use. Illicit 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is also common among street-involved youth, and data suggest this substance has clinical utility in management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated harms. Despite this, little is known about co-occurring patterns of MDMA use and injection drug use. Methods: Data were derived from a prospective cohort of street-involved youth using illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada. Using multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression, we examined the association between MDMA use and the use of injection drugs, adjusting for confounders such as polysubstance use and sociodemographic factors. Results: 4941 surveys from 1208 participants between September 2005 and May 2015 were included. Of these, 829 (68.6%) were male, 815 (67.5%) reported white ethnicity, and median age was 21.7 years. Overall, 599 (49.6%) participants reported MDMA use, 544 (45.0%) reported injection drug use, and 244 (20.2%) reported concurrent MDMA and injection drug use at least once during the study period. In multivariable analyses, regular MDMA use was significantly negatively associated with injection drug use (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.46â€“0.69). Discussion: After accounting for socio-demographic factors and polysubstance use, periods of reported regular MDMA use were negatively associated with reported injection drug use among this cohort. These findings suggest that, unlike the use of most other non-injection drugs, illicit MDMA use does not appear to promote injection drug use but rather is associated with a reduced likelihood of injection drug use.","L2001115809     2018-09-25     2018-10-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.07.035,"illicit drug;midomafetamine;adult;alcohol consumption;article;Canada;controlled study;demography;drug abuse;ethnicity;female;follow up;heroin dependence;homeless youth;human;major clinical study;male;multivariate logistic regression analysis;odds ratio;physical abuse;prevalence;priority journal;risk assessment;risk factor;risk reduction;self report;substance use;Adolescent;N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Gadermann, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Aims: Previous research has shown that homelessness and unstable housing are associated with poor physical and mental health functioning. Less is known about the subjective quality of life (SQOL) of homeless and vulnerably housed individuals (HVHs). A deeper understanding of the correlates of SQOL of HVHs is helpful to researchers, service providers, and policy-makers in their evaluations of the impact of homelessness on HVHs and the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving their lives. The purpose of this study was to examine predictors of SQOL of HVHs. Methods: Data were obtained from the Health and Housing in Transition (HHiT) study, a 4-year Canadian longitudinal multi-site cohort study (N = 1190; response rate at follow-up 4: 79%). At each time point, trained research assistants administered structured interviews. SQOL was assessed with the Quality of Life of Homeless and Vulnerably Housed Individuals Instrument, specifically developed and validated with this population. Predictor variables were assessed with validated measures of housing status, housing quality, social support, physical and mental health problems, and problematic substance use. Multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis was used to examine the association between predictor variables and SQOL, adjusting for demographic variables including age, gender, ethnicity, employment status, and income, and time point. Results: Problematic substance use (ÃŸ = - 0.25; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) - 0.31, - 0.19), mental and physical health conditions (ÃŸ = - 0.15; 95% CI - 0.23, - 0.07 and ÃŸ = - 0.21; CI - 0.3, - 0.13, respectively), and residential instability (ÃŸ = - 0.03; 95% CI - 0.05, - 0.02) were independently associated with lower SQOL, whereas good housing quality (ÃŸ = 0.05; 95% CI 0.04, 0.05) and perceived social support (ÃŸ = 0.09; 95% CI 0.08, 0.1) were associated with higher SQOL. Conclusions: The findings point to the fact that in seeking to understand SQoL among HVHs, it is important to look beyond health and housing status. Social support and housing quality appear to be significant predictors of SQOL when taking health and residential stability into account.","L624431004     2018-10-23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s11136-018-1946-9,adult;cohort analysis;conference abstract;controlled study;employment status;ethnicity;female;follow up;gender;housing;human;major clinical study;male;mental disease;multicenter study;physical disability;predictor variable;quality of life;scientist;social aspect;social support;structured interview;substance use;Quality of Life,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

We investigated the association between moderate-severely bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and psychological general wellbeing in women, aged 40-65 years, taking into account socio-demographic and lifestyle factors. Study design/Main outcome measures: This was a cross-sectional survey of 2020 Australian women, aged 40-65 years, recruited from the community between July 2013 and March 2014. Wellbeing was assessed by the Psychological and General Wellbeing questionnaire (PGWB) and VMS by the Menopause-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. Results: Moderate-severely bothersome VMS had a strong significant negative association with psychological general wellbeing [regression coefficient (beta) = -8.17,95% confidence interval (CI) -10.90 to -5.45]. Socio-demographic factors associated with lower wellbeing included being un-partnered (beta = -2.80,95% CI -4.74 to -0.86), obese (beta = -5.46, 95% CI -7.24 to -3.68) and a smoker (beta = -3.47, 95% CI -6.10 to -0.84). Older age (beta = 0.29, 95% CI 0.06-0.42) and participation in paid and/or volunteer work (beta = 2.72, 95% CI 0.61-4.82) were positively associated with wellbeing. For those with insecure housing, being a carer was associated with better wellbeing. Conclusions: Moderate-severely bothersome VMS are significantly and independently negatively associated with psychological general wellbeing in women at midlife.

Gelpi-Acosta, NIDA Behavioral Science Training in Drug Abuse Research, National Development and Research Institute, New York City, NY, United States","Aims: Background: In the U.S., there are two main theories around opioid addiction: (1) opioid addiction is a medical disease (MD) that requires pharmacotherapy (e.g., methadone); and (2) addiction is an illness that requires complete abstinence - even prescribed medications - (abstinence model-AM). While AM programs have comparatively large attrition rates, continued heroin among methadone patients (MPs) does occur. Inquiries on drug users' perceptions of their drug use as they relate to the MD and AM theories are scarce, and drug users' rationales for continued heroin use despite MP status remain unclear. Aims: To increase our understanding of heroin users' perceptions of their own drug use based on the MD and AM theories, and to identify rationales behind continued heroin use despite MP status. Hypothesis: Heroin users, particularly MPs, experience their drug use along the lines of the MD theory Methods: Research methods included field observations, snowball sampling and in-depth interviews with street heroin users, some of which were MPs, in NYC. MP enrollment guided recruitment. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded. Common experiences around the MD and AM models and heroin use were identified using a grounded theory approach. Results: Four participants (2 MPs) were recruited by the researcher and these recruited 24 participants. Of 28 participants, 15 were MPs. Most were Hispanic (57%) and Caucasian (32%). Most were homeless (64%) males (86%) with High School or less (86%). The average age was 37. All were using heroin. Regardless of MP status, a common theme around drug use rationales was â€œweak willâ€, resembling the AM addiction theory. Also, heroin-centered emotions, identities and minds influence heroin use. This phenomenon resembles a Junkie habitus, displaying deeply-ingrained heroin dispositions. Conclusions: Regardless of MP status, the AM model is pervasive and a Junkie habitus influences continued heroin use. More research is needed to understand the interplay between the deep lying rained abstinence-based subjectivities and continued drug use despite MP status.","L71802235     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.250,"diamorphine;opiate;methadone;morality;college;drug dependence;drug use;human;addiction;abstinence;model;interview;drug therapy;grounded theory;diseases;sampling;hypothesis;United States;patient;male;scientist;identity;emotion;high school;Caucasian;Hispanic;Habituation, Psychophysiologic",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This study examined rates and correlates of tobacco use among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women. Methods Participants (N = 771) were drawn from the baseline assessment of an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of racially diverse MSM aged 16â€“29 years. Data collection took place in 2015â€“2016. Socio-demographic and SGM-specific (e.g., gender identity, sexual identity, physical attraction) correlates of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use were identified using logistic regression. Results Twenty-one percent were current cigarette smokers. Nearly 40% ever tried an e-cigarette, but regular e-cigarette use was low (3.8%). Smokers were more likely to be older (vs. aged 16â€“18), less educated, homeless, bisexual or identify as some other sexual minority (vs. gay), attracted to males and females equally or more attracted to females than males (vs. males only), and HIV-positive. E-cigarette users were more likely to be transgender women (vs. cisgender men), White (vs. Black), more educated, and mostly attracted to females. Conclusions Findings highlight important risk factors for tobacco use among SGM youth. Correlates of smoking mirrored findings observed in the general population, but also included factors specific to SGM youth (e.g., sexual orientation, HIV status, homelessness). Although some variables (gender identity, attraction) demonstrated similar relationships with smoking and e-cigarette use, others (race/ethnicity, education) demonstrated opposite patterns.

Veterans receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System (VA) constitute a population that is vulnerable to alcohol misuse and homelessness. This research examines the effects of hazardous drinking on homelessness in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, a sample of 2898 older veterans (mean age=50.2), receiving care in 8 VAs across the country. Methods: Logistic regression models examined the associations between (1) hazardous drinking at baseline and homelessness at 1-year follow-up, (2) transitions into and out of hazardous drinking from baseline to follow-up and homelessness at follow-up, and (3) transitioning to hazardous drinking and transitioning to homelessness from baseline to follow-up during that same time-period. Results: After controlling for other correlates including alcohol dependence, hazardous drinking at baseline increased the risk of homelessness at follow-up (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02, 1.88). Transitioning to hazardous drinking more than doubled the risk of homelessness at follow-up (AOR=2.42,95% CI=1.41, 4.15), while more than doubling the risk of transitioning from being housed at baseline to being homeless at follow-up (AOR=2.49, 95% CI=1.30, 4.79).

The problem has gradually worsened since closure of state hospitals and subsequent lack of community resources. It has been stalemated, in part, by advocates, who argue for personal autonomy and freedom rather than involuntary diagnosis and treatment over the life of these people. It has reached a crisis situation secondary to such potential patients being imprisoned and/or sick with COVID-19 being potential health and legal threats. We review A) the nature of the problem, B) the current social-legal availability of treatment and long-term management (or lack of one) in the context of societal rejection of these potential patients, and C) suggest what might be done, locally and nationally. Mandating scientifically-based medical orders to citizens regardless of personal freedom â€“ are now being implemented to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

Local drug problem indicators suggest that methamphetamine use is increasing. The extent to which this increase affects MSM and non-MSM, and whether MSM and non-MSM networks are connected through injection equipment sharing, is unknown. Methods We used data from two serial cross-sectional surveys of PWID including five biannual surveys of Public Healthâ€“Seattle and King County Needle and Syringe Exchange Program clients (NSEP, N = 2135, 2009â€“2017) and three National HIV Behavioral Surveillance IDU surveys (NHBS, N = 1709, 2009â€“2015). Results The proportion of non-MSM PWID reporting any recent methamphetamine injection increased significantly from approximately 20% in 2009 to 65% in 2017. Most of this increase was attributable to injecting methamphetamine in combination with heroin (goofballs). PWID who injected goofballs were more likely to be younger, homeless or unstably housed, report daily injection, and self-report an opioid overdose in the past year than other PWID. The majority of PWID who injected methamphetamine reported sharing any injection equipment. Among these PWID, 43% of MSM had last shared injection equipment with a non-MSM. Eight percent of non-MSM men and 15% of women had last shared equipment with an MSM. Conclusions Given non-trivial rates of sharing injection equipment with methamphetamine-using MSM, a population with an HIV prevalence of 40%, non-MSM who inject methamphetamine could be an emerging population at risk for acquiring HIV.","L619354444     2017-11-27     2018-09-25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.10.011,diamorphine;methamphetamine;opiate;adult;age;article;controlled study;drug overdose;female;homeless man;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;injection;male;men who have sex with men;priority journal;self report;Washington;Methamphetamine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This paper examines care leaversâ€™ experience of securing housing during the transition out of care through the lenses of liminality, Recognition theory, and precarity. Conducted in Ireland, sixteen care-experienced youth were recruited to a qualitative longitudinal study. The findings demonstrate how aftercare policies and a lack of affordable housing combined to create precarity for many, which also had implications for their feelings of recognition as young people. For those who remained in their foster care placements or transitioned to supported lodgings, housing stability engendered feelings of being cared for by creating a liminal space where growth was supported. Those, on the other hand, who left their foster care placements at the age of 18 or were forced to leave time-limited aftercare housing were pushed into precariousness, placing them at high risk for homelessness and housing exclusion. These young people felt misrecognised and disrespected by the state and the aftercare system. The findings highlight the deleterious consequences of time-limited aftercare supports for care leaversâ€™ sense of security and their ability to achieve valued life goals. The implications of the study's findings for leaving care and aftercare policies are discussed. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

The European Union and World Health Organization aspire to eliminate HCV by 2030. However, among at-risk populations, including, homeless people, prisoners and People Who Inject Drugs, access to diagnosis and treatment is challenging. Hepcare Europe is an integrated model of care developed to address this by assessing potential reasons for these restrictions and determining measures needed to improve HCV diagnosis, treatment and access to care within different communities. OBJECTIVES: HepCare Europe is an EU-supported project involving collaboration between five institutions in: Ireland, United Kingdom, Spain and Romania. We aim to explore the journey of care experienced by those living with HCV with a focus on previous care disruptions (loss to follow up) and the new HepCare Europe Programme. METHODS: Research teams conducted semi-structured interviews with patients who accessed services through HepCare Europe thus, patients were recruited by purposeful sampling. Patients interviewed had received, or were in the final weeks of receiving, treatment. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and translated into English, and sent to the Dublin team for inductive thematic analysis. Researchers from the HepCare Europe research team coded the data separately, then together. RESULTS: Common themes are introduced to present similarities, following individual site themes to highlight the importance of tailored interventions for each country. Key themes are: 1) Hepatitis C patients lost to follow up 2) HepCare improved access to treatment and 3) the need for improved HCV education. Individual themes also emerged for each site. These are: Ireland: New opportunities associated with achieving Sustained Virologic Responses (SVR). Romania: HCV is comparatively less crucial in light of Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV) coinfections. UK: Patients desire support to overcome social barriers and Spain: Improved awareness of HCV, treatment and alcohol use. CONCLUSION: This study identified how the tailored HepCare interventions enabled improved HCV testing and linkage to care outcomes for these patients. Tailored interventions that targeted the needs of patients, increased the acceptability and success of treatment by patients. HepCare demonstrated the need for flexibility in treatment delivery, and provided additional supports to keep patients engaged and educated on new treatment therapies.","1471-2334     Glaspy, Shannon     Avramovic, Gordana     McHugh, Tina     Oprea, Cristiana     Surey, Julian     Ianache, Irina     MacÃ­as, Juan     Story, Alistair     Cullen, Walter     Lambert, John S     Journal Article     England     BMC Infect Dis. 2021 Mar 5;21(1):239. doi: 10.1186/s12879-021-05928-9. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Use (Hep C),Health care - Access (Hep C)",10.1186/s12879-021-05928-9,Adult;*Delivery of Health Care;Drug Users;Europe;Female;Hepacivirus;Hepatitis C/*diagnosis/*therapy;Homeless Persons;Humans;Ireland;Male;Middle Aged;Prisoners;Romania;Spain;Sustained Virologic Response;United Kingdom;Hepatitis C;Homeless;Integrated HCV care;Lost to follow up (LTFU);People who inject drugs (PWID);Vulnerable populations,,,Y,N,Included

O.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L75000156&from=export,English,,,"OBJECTIVES: 1.Compare and discuss the nature of and risk factors for the various forms of adolescent sexual violence in culturally diverse/multinational urban settings 2.Explore known preventative strategies and discuss novel approaches to identification and intervention. METHODS: Sexual violence affects individuals of all ages, cultures, gender, orientation and abilities. Some groups may be disproportionately affected. 30% of under 18s in London, England, are non-white but in the years 2008â€“2011, 50% of 13- 17 year olds attending the London Havens Sexual Assault Referral Centres came from census groups other than White British, White Irish or White Other. Ten percent had learning difficulties compared with a population average of 2.5%. Based on evidence submitted to the current CSEGG (Child Sexual Exploitation In Gangs* and Groups*) Inquiry in England, at least 16,500 children under 18 years were identified as being at risk of child sexual exploitation during one year and 2,409 children were confirmed as victims of sexual exploitation in gangs and groups during the 14-month period from August 2010 to October 2011. There was a higher rate of victimisation amongst black and minority ethnic (BME) children and young people than has been previously identified. (* where gangs mainly comprise men and boys aged 13 â€“ 25 years old, who take part in many forms of criminal activity, such as knife crime or robbery, who can engage in violence against other gangs, and who have identifiable markers such as territory, a name, sometimes clothing etc. While children can be sexually exploited by a gang, this is not the reason why a gang is formed. Groups involves people who come together in person or online for the purpose of setting up, co-ordinating and/or taking part in the sexual exploitation of children in either an organised or opportunistic way.) In terms of intimate partner violence in adolescent relationships, a recent National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) study in the UK echoed findings in the USA in that high numbers of adolescents experience physical, emotional and sexual violence in their intimate partner relationships (a quarter of girls and 18 per cent of boys reported some form of physical partner violence, three-quarters of girls and half of boys reported some form of emotional partner violence. One in three girls and 16 per cent of boys reported some form of sexual partner violence). The incidence, frequency and level of negative impacts rates for all forms of violence were greater for girls. The majority of young people either told a friend about the violence or told no one. Most respondents in this study were white. We propose an interactive session to: â€¢compare and contrast risk factors for adolescent sexual assault among urban youth in major cities of different countries with attention given to particular characteristics and vulnerabilities associated with adolescents who are trafficked, homeless, unaccompanied minors run-aways and/or in the care of the state â€¢share experiences of preventative strategies among workshop attendersâ€“ including government/public health preventative policies and measures, school-based educational measures or those targeted at preventing revictimisation â€¢identify and discuss obstacles to interventions: particularly those related to culture, social marginalisation and legal frameworks â€¢examine and discuss efficacy of interventions CONCLUSIONS:Large numbers of adolescents are victims of sexual violence and exploitation in settings outside the family: in intimate partnerships and by gangs and groups. There are high rates of under-identification. Better understanding of the settings, susceptible groups, risk factors and behavioural identifiers that might increase the likelihood that an adolescent is a victim of sexual violence is needed. In many countries existing health, judicial and social care structures have started but struggle to address these emerging problems. Effective strategies are needed for education and early identification of at-ris adolescents and treatment of those already affected by sexual violence.","L75000156     2013-11-07 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",,marker;adolescent;human;sexual violence;adolescent health;risk factor;child;gang;male;United Kingdom;boy;sexual exploitation;partner violence;girl;female;victim;violence;sexual assault;health;risk;offender;population research;social care;school;policy;workshop;city;juvenile;gender;friend;sexuality;prevention;society;clothing;population;crime;education;learning disorder;Risk Factors;Adolescent;Sex Offenses,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Given these gaps and the disproportionate burden of criminalization borne by Indigenous SWs, we evaluated (1) structural correlates of unsuccessful attempts to access substance use treatment; and (2) the interaction between policing and Indigenous ancestry on unsuccessful attempts to access treatment among SWs who use drugs. Methods: Prospective data were from an open community-based cohort of women SWs (2010â€“2019) in Vancouver, Canada. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations(GEE) assessed correlates of unsuccessful attempts to access treatment. A multivariable GEE confounder model examined the interaction between Indigenous ancestry and policing on unsuccessful attempts to access treatment. Results: Amongst 645 SWs who used drugs, 32.1 % reported unsuccessful attempts to access substance use treatment during the 9.5-year study. In multivariable GEE analysis, unsuccessful substance use treatment access was associated with identifying as a sexual/gender minority (AOR: 1.90, 95 %CI:1.37â€“2.63), opioid use (AOR: 1.43, 95 %CI: 1.07â€“1.91), and exposure to homelessness (AOR: 1.72; 95 %CI:1.33â€“2.21), police harassment (AOR: 1.48, 95 %CI:1.03â€“2.13), workplace violence (AOR: 1.80, 95 %CI: 1.31â€“2.49) and intimate partner violence (AOR: 2.11, 95 %CI:1.50â€“2.97). In interaction analysis, Indigenous SWs who experienced police harassment faced the highest odds of unsuccessful attempts to access substance use treatment (AOR: 2.59, 95 %CI:1.65â€“4.05). Conclusion: Findings suggest a need to scale-up culturally-safe, trauma-informed addictions, gender-based violence, and sex worker services, alongside dismantling of systemic racism across and beyond health and addictions services.","L2018925041     2022-06-29     2022-07-22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109506,opiate;adult;article;Canada;community;criminal behavior;drug use;female;harassment;homelessness;human;major clinical study;partner violence;police;racism;sex worker;sexual and gender minority;substance use;violence;workplace violence;Violence,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Centre on Substance Use, 400 - 1045 Howe Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Background: Emerging evidence suggests that non-medical prescription opioid (NMPO) use may be a risk factor for initiating heroin use; however, pathways from PO to heroin use among youth remain underexplored. We sought to examine the association between NMPO use and heroin initiation. Methods: Between September 2005 and June 2017 data were derived from an open prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14â€“28 who use illegal drugs in Vancouver, Canada. The study included 526 youth who had never used non-injection heroin, and 652 youth who had never used injection heroin at baseline. We used Cox proportional hazards regressions to examine the association between NMPO use â€“ in addition to other substance use patterns â€“ and subsequent initiation into non-injection and injection heroin use. Results: Among those who had never used non-injection heroin at baseline, 133 (25.3%) initiated non-injection heroin use during the study period. Among those who had never injected heroin at baseline, 137 (21.0%) initiated heroin injection during the study period. In multivariable analyses, NMPO use, crack use, and crystal methamphetamine use predicted non-injection heroin initiation (all p < 0.05). In separate multivariable analyses, non-injection heroin and crystal methamphetamine predicted heroin injection initiation (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Among street-involved youth in this setting, NMPO use predicted initiation into non-injection heroin use but not initiation into heroin injection. Interestingly, crack cocaine and crystal methamphetamine use were stronger predictors of heroin initiation than NMPO use was, suggesting that stimulant use may carry greater risks for heroin initiation than NMPO use.","L2003283191     2019-10-09     2019-10-10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107579,diamorphine;illicit drug;methamphetamine;adolescent;adult;article;Canada;Canadian;cohort analysis;controlled study;crack use;crystal;disease association;drug use;explanatory variable;female;follow up;hazard ratio;heroin dependence;homeless youth;human;longitudinal study;major clinical study;male;mathematical analysis;multivariate analysis;non medical prescription opioid use;prediction;priority journal;proportional hazards model;prospective study;Cohort Studies;Heroin;Adolescent,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Data were obtained from a demographic and clinical history interview conducted with 3595 homeless veterans. Odds-ratio (OR) statistics were used to assess potential for suicidal behavior. Statistically significant ratios were similar for ideation and attempts. The highest ratios were for self-report of depression and difficulty controlling violence, but statistically significant ratios were found for reporting sleeping in a treatment facility the night before the interview, receiving VA support for a psychiatric condition, and the diagnoses of Alcoholism, Mood Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Low but statistically significant odds-ratios were obtained for most of the physical health items. A negative odds-ratio was obtained for African-American ethnicity. Logistic regression results indicated that for ideation and attempts items entered first involved subjective report of trouble controlling violent behavior and experiencing depression. High odds ratios for the interview items concerning experiencing serious depression and having difficulties controlling violence may have strong implications for treatment and management of homeless veterans. There may be up to 14-1 odds that an individual who reports being seriously depressed or having difficulty inhibiting aggression may have a serious potential for suicidal behaviors.

Golla, Department of Palliative Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany","In order to facilitate cooperation between neurology and palliative and hospice care (PHC) and to ease patient's access to these structures, a nationwide hotline for people affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) was established in Germany, and the experience of the first year analysed. The hotline was designed and introduced to the MS community in cooperation with the German Multiple Sclerosis Society (DMSG). Calls were documented using a standardized case report form supplemented by personal notes after each call. In cases where PHC services were recommended, follow-up calls were intended. Data was analysed descriptively. During the first year (09/2014 - 08/2015), 156 calls (79 patients, 37 caregivers, 5 members of patient associations (e.g. DMSG), 5 health professionals, one other hotline, 29 unknown) were documented and analysed. Patients (mean age: 50.7 years; range: 28-84; 54% male) had an average illness duration of 19.63 years (range: 2 month - 50 years). 82% of the patients were living in their own homes, 12% in nursing homes, 6% in other places (one patient was homeless). Main symptoms reported by callers were 1) symptoms evolving due to MS (49%): e.g. limited mobility, impairment of speech; 2) typical palliative symptoms (28%): e.g. severe pain, breathing difficulties; and 3) psychosocial problems (35%): e.g. inadequate living conditions, psychological distress and burden of relatives. In 6% of cases the caller brought up the topic of death and dying. 10% of callers reported difficulties in accessing PHC structures. 40% of all calls were deemed eligible for PHC and recommendations for available services were given. Results indicate that the hotline is broadly accepted. Although patients expressed a wide range of problems showing the need for PHC, in some cases they were refused these structures. The hotline now helps to facilitate access to palliative and hospice care structures.","L614041186     2017-01-17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1177/0269216316646056,adult;caregiver;death;disease course;dyspnea;female;follow up;hospice care;hotline;human;limited mobility;major clinical study;male;mental stress;middle aged;multiple sclerosis;nursing home;pain;psychosocial disorder;relative;speech disorder;symptom;Hospice Care;Multiple Sclerosis;Hospices,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

If another risk factor like alcohol and drug consumption, o any other condition like mental disabilities, chronic illness, or HIV, the problem is worse. The objective is to describe what special conditions makes our patients a more suitable candidate for a contraceptive implant. Materials: Charts and Clinical register of 173 adolescents inserted with ImplanoÂ® controled in 3 specialized Adolescent centers in Santiago de Chile that offers free or low cost attention. Contraceptives are free. Methods: Chart review of 173 patients from 13 to 20 years-old inserted between September 2006 and September 2011. Results: Average age was 16.2 years-old. 66.5% nulliparous and 33.5% multiparous. Diagnosis was categorized in Psychosocial factors and Medical conditions. The first one include: a. Problematic Alcohol consumption and/or Drug consumption: 11 patients (6.4%) b. High psychosocial risk, such as homeless, school dropout, multiple sexual partners, child prostitution represents a 23%. c. Previous teen pregnancy where a total of 58 patients (33.5%), one third of them have another psychosocial risk factor like drug consumption or mental disabilities. The medical conditions were: a. Mental health problems: depressions, suicide intentions, eating disorders, family dysfunction: 7% b. Neurologic conditions: Epilepsy, Mental Retardation: 12 patients (7%) c. Cardiopathies: 2 patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Hypertension d. HIV: 2 patients e. Genetic Syndromes: Williams Syndrome 1, Cornelia de Lange syndrome 1, both have mental retardation. f. Other: Renal Transplant, Fatty liver, morbid obesity. A total of 50 patients were healthy nulliparous adolescents that represent a 29%. Conclusions: In high-risk adolescents it is imperative to prevent pregnancy. The use of ImplanoÂ® in this group of adolescents represents a very important tool for prevention, with better compliance and little contraindications. In our country we also have available other free LARCS such as IUD o DMPA, both accepted in this age group, but since we have available ImplanoÂ® (a OMS category 1 eligibility criteria), we prefer this one above the others when oral contraceptives or combine injectable contraception is contraindicated or its difficult to use because of the adolescent characteristics. It also represents a good choice when other medications are used and interferes with COCs. Since 2/3 of our adolescents are nulliparous, the use of IUD is not our first option (OMS 2 category).","L70906206     2012-10-31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/S0020-7292(12)61303-4,contraceptive agent;alcohol;oral contraceptive agent;human;implant;gynecology;obstetrics;adolescent;female;patient;mental deficiency;drug use;contraception;risk;risk factor;pregnancy;school;morbid obesity;alcohol consumption;de Lange syndrome;social psychology;diagnosis;kidney graft;prevention;groups by age;drug therapy;sexuality;medical record review;Williams Beuren syndrome;Chile;genetic disorder;pulmonary hypertension;register;epilepsy;eating disorder;suicide;chronic disease;mental health;intrauterine contraceptive device;fatty liver;Human immunodeficiency virus;child;prostitution;Adolescent,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

However, application of structured, self-assessment tools to evaluate differences in knowledge gained by learners who participate in such training has not yet been addressed. Methods: Participants (n?=?142) of an elective with the hospital-based Addiction Medicine Consult Team (AMCT) in Vancouver, Canada, responded to an online self-evaluation survey before and immediately after the structured elective. Areas covered included substance use screening, history taking, signs and symptoms examination, withdrawal treatment, relapse prevention, nicotine use disorders, opioid use disorders, safe prescribing, and the biology of substance use disorders. A purposefully selected sample of 18 trainees were invited to participate in qualitative interviews that elicited feedback on the rotation. Results: Of 168 invited trainees, 142 (84.5%) completed both pre- and post-rotation self-assessments between May 2015 and May 2017. Follow-up participants included medical students, residents, addiction medicine fellows, and family physicians in practice.

Goulis, Unit of Reproductive Endocrinology, 1(st) Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece","Health problems of women experiencing homelessness are driven either from the usual background characteristics of this population, or from the homeless lifestyle. Apart from poverty and unemployment, transition to homelessness is often associated with substance abuse, history of victimization, stress, poor mental health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Water insecurity can undermine bodily hygiene and dental health, posing a greater risk of dehydration and opportunistic infections. Exposure to extreme environmental conditions like heat waves and natural disasters increases morbidity, accelerates aging, and reduces life expectancy. Nutrition-wise, a high prevalence of food insecurity, obesity, and micronutrient deficiencies are apparent due to low diet quality and food waste. Poor hygiene, violence, and overcrowding increase the susceptibility of these women to communicable diseases, including sexually transmitted ones and COVID-19. Furthermore, established cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus are often either undertreated or neglected, and their complications are more widespread than in the general population. In addition, lack of medical screening and contraception non-use induce a variety of reproductive health issues. All these health conditions are tightly related to violations of human rights in this population, including the rights to housing, water, food, reproduction, health, work, and no discrimination. Thus, the care provided to women experiencing homelessness should be optimized at a multidimensional level, spanning beyond the provision of a warm bed, to include access to clean water and sanitation, psychological support and stress-coping strategies, disease management and acute health care, food of adequate quality, opportunities for employment and support for any minor dependants.","L2014703063     2021-09-28     2021-10-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.maturitas.2021.09.007,aging;alcohol consumption;cardiovascular disease;cardiovascular risk;climate change;communicable disease;contraception;coronavirus disease 2019;crowding (area);dental health;diabetes mellitus;domestic violence;drug abuse;employment;ethnicity;extreme environment;female;food insecurity;food quality;food waste;health care access;health status;homelessness;human;Human immunodeficiency virus;human rights abuse;hunger;hyperglycemia;malnutrition;menopause;menstruation;mental health;nutrient intake;nutritional deficiency;parasitosis;personal hygiene;physical inactivity;pregnancy;premature aging;public health;reproductive health;review;sanitation;sexual abuse;sexually transmitted disease;sleep;social status;substance abuse;tooth disease;vulnerable population;water insecurity;wellbeing;women's health;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Health Status,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

High-cost, high-need users are defined as patients who accumulate large numbers of emergency department visits and hospital admissions that might have been prevented by relatively inexpensive early interventions and primary care. This phenomenon has not been previously described in HIV-infected individuals. Methods. We analyzed the health records of HIV-infected individuals using scheduled or unscheduled inpatient or outpatient health care in St Jamesâ€™s Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, from October 2014 to October 2015. Results. Twenty-two of 2063 HIV-infected individuals had a cumulative length of stay >30 days in the study period. These individuals accrued 99 emergency department attendances and 1581 inpatient bed days, with a direct cost to the hospital of >â‚¬1 million during the study period. Eighteen of 22 had potentially preventable requirements for unscheduled care. Two of 18 had a late diagnosis of HIV. Sixteen of 18 had not been successfully engaged in outpatient HIV care and presented with consequences of advanced HIV. Fourteen of 16 of those who were not successfully engaged in care had â‰¥1 barrier to care (addiction, psychiatric disease, and/ or homelessness). Conclusions. A small number of HIV-infected individuals account for a high volume of acute unscheduled care. Intensive engagement in outpatient care may prevent some of this usage and ensuing costs.

An alternative model, Housing First, reversed the order of services so that homeless individuals are offered immediate access to independent housing, with wraparound supports but no treatment or abstinence requirements. Although the evidence base for Housing First's effectiveness in ending homelessness is robust, less is known about its effectiveness in promoting recovery. Objective: The objective of this research is to compare rehabilitation- and recovery-related outcomes of homeless services users who are engaged in either Housing First or traditional staircase services in eight European countries: France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. Methods: A mixed methods, multi-site investigation of Housing First and traditional services will compare quantitative outcomes at two time points. Key rehabilitation outcomes include stable housing and psychiatric symptoms. Key growth outcomes include community integration and acquired capabilities. Semistructured interviews will be used to examine service users' experiences of environmental constraints and affordances on acquired capabilities to identify features of homeless services that enhance service users' capabilities sets. Multi-level modelling will be used to test for group differences-Housing First versus traditional services-on key outcome variables. Thematic analysis will be used to understand the ways in which service users make sense of internal and external affordances and constraints on capabilities. Results: The study is registered with the European Commission (registration number: H2020-5C6-REVINEQUAL-2016/GA726997). Two press releases, a research report to the funding body, two peer-reviewed articles, and an e-book chapter are planned for dissemination of the final results. The project was funded from September 2016 through September 2019. Expected results will be disseminated in 2019 and 2020. Conclusions: We will use the findings from this research to formulate recommendations for European social policy on the configuration of homeless services and the scaling up and scaling out of Housing First programs. From our findings, we will draw conclusions about the setting features that promote individuals' exits from homelessness, rehabilitation, and recovery.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 2 Total Times Cited: 2 Cited Reference Count: 62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.2196/14584,homeless services;Housing First;recovery;capabilities;SERIOUS MENTAL-ILLNESS;SUBSTANCE-ABUSE;INDIVIDUALS;OUTCOMES;CHOICE;SATISFACTION;ADAPTATION;PEOPLE;HEALTH;ADULTS,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

M. and Manning, R. M.",,eng,,"Department of Psychology, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.     IKON Research Centre, Warwick University, Warwick, UK.","Previous research demonstrated the importance of consumer choice and mastery to residential stability and psychiatric functioning for adults with histories of homelessness. In the present study, we investigated whether these relationships hold, even in the context of problem-related substance misuse. Questionnaire data were collected in Ireland from 101 residents of long-term homeless accommodation in 2010. Hayes' PROCESS macro for mediation and moderation analysis in SPSS was employed to test our hypotheses. Findings demonstrated that the indirect effect of choice through mastery on psychiatric functioning was stronger for individuals with more recent problem-related substance use than for those with no or distant histories of problem-related substance use. Our findings confirm that consumer choice in housing and services is important to homeless services users' recovery experiences. Because of its relationship with mastery, consumer choice in housing and services protects homeless services users' psychiatric functioning, especially when substance use-related choices have had negative consequences. Our findings suggest that if homeless services take away consumer choice when substance use causes problems, they may actually undermine, rather than foster, service users' psychiatric functioning.","1365-2524     Greenwood, Ronni Michelle     Manning, Rachel M     Orcid: 0000-0003-2254-1484     Journal Article     England     Health Soc Care Community. 2017 May;25(3):1050-1060. doi: 10.1111/hsc.12405.

As HF programs become more widespread, it is important to understand how service users experience them compared to the more prevalent traditional treatment-first approach to addressing long-term homelessness. Although there is a large body of research on service users' experiences of Housing First compared to treatment-first in North American contexts, comparatively less is known about how these two categories of homeless services are experienced in the European context. In a correlational and cross-sectional study, part of a larger examination of homelessness in Europe, participants (nÂ =Â 520) engaged with either HF (nÂ =Â 245) or traditional services (TS;Â nÂ =Â 275) programs in seven countries completed measures of their experiences of services (consumer choice, housing quality, and service satisfaction) and recovery (time in independent housing, psychiatric symptoms, and community integration). Across the seven countries, participants engaged with HF programs reported experiencing more consumer choice, better perceived housing quality, and more satisfaction with services than participants engaged in TS programs. Participants in HF programs also reported a greater proportion of time in independent accommodation, fewer psychiatric symptoms, and more community integration. Varying patterns of association between experiences of services and recovery outcomes were observed. Findings indicate HF consistently predicts greater recovery than TS across diverse sociopolitical and economic contexts. Implications of findings for configurations of homeless services and homeless services policy are discussed.","1573-2770     Greenwood, Ronni Michelle     Manning, Rachel M     Orcid: 0000-0003-2254-1484     O'Shaughnessy, Branagh R     Orcid: 0000-0003-4417-7273     Vargas-Moniz, Maria J     Orcid: 0000-0002-4875-9118     LoubiÃ¨re, Sandrine     Orcid: 0000-0001-6715-1223     Spinnewijn, Freek     Lenzi, Michela     Orcid: 0000-0001-7721-2448     Wolf, Judith R     Orcid: 0000-0001-7106-9142     Bokszczanin, Anna     Orcid: 0000-0002-0499-8133     Bernad, Roberto     Orcid: 0000-0002-6878-1419     KÃ¤llmÃ©n, HÃ¥kan     Orcid: 0000-0001-9288-3864     Ornelas, JosÃ©     Orcid: 0000-0002-8972-7518     HOME-EU Consortium Study Group     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     Am J Community Psychol. 2020 Jun;65(3-4):353-368. doi: 10.1002/ajcp.12404.

Key stakeholders representing six European HF initiatives completed semi-structured phone interviews. Interviews were thematically analyzed according to five key fidelity domains and updated with interim results of a recent European research project (Housing First Europe). Dissatisfaction with the status quo was often cited as the catalyst driving searches for system change. PHF's evidence base, consumer-driven philosophy, recovery-oriented services, and view of housing as a basic right swayed local decisions to implement HF programs. Interviews yielded stronger evidence of fidelity on no housing readiness requirements, separation of housing and services, a harm reduction approach, consumer choice in services, and weaker evidence of fidelity on scatter-site housing, choice in housing, and breadth and intensity of services provided. Implementation challenges included resistance from existing programs, availability of affordable housing, and moral judgments of worthiness for housing. Both new and established programs evidenced high commitment to PHF principles and philosophy, but older programs demonstrated greater fidelity on a wider range of indicators. Early evidence indicates that HF can be successfully replicated within the European context, though local historical, social, and political factors may impact fidelity. Many programs committed to fidelity in principle faced external or financial barriers to implementation. Strategic planning and training to ensure that the programs unfold and mature in ways that realize HF principles in practice is recommended.

Although the burden of temperature-associated mortality may shift towards high temperatures in the future, cold temperatures may represent a greater current-day problem in temperate cities. Hot and cold temperature vulnerabilities may coincide across several personal and neighborhood characteristics, suggesting opportunities for increasing present and future resilience to extreme temperatures. We present a narrative literature review encompassing the epidemiology of cold- and heat-related mortality and morbidity, related physiologic and environmental mechanisms, and municipal responses to hot and cold weather, illustrated by Detroit, Michigan, USA, a financially burdened city in an economically diverse metropolitan area. The Detroit area experiences sharp increases in mortality and hospitalizations with extreme heat, while cold temperatures are associated with more gradual increases in mortality, with no clear threshold. Interventions such as heating and cooling centers may reduce but not eliminate temperature-associated health problems. Furthermore, direct hemodynamic responses to cold, sudden exertion, poor indoor air quality and respiratory epidemics likely contribute to cold-related mortality. Short- and long-term interventions to enhance energy and housing security and housing quality may reduce temperature-related health problems. Extreme temperatures can increase morbidity and mortality in municipalities like Detroit that experience both extreme heat and prolonged cold seasons amidst large socioeconomic disparities. The similarities in physiologic and built-environment vulnerabilities to both hot and cold weather suggest prioritization of strategies that address both present-day cold and near-future heat concerns.","L2000854564     2018-06-21     2018-10-11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.maturitas.2018.06.002,ambient air;climate change;cold;cooling;environmental disease;heat;heating;homelessness;hospitalization;housing;human;morbidity;mortality;neighborhood;occupational exposure;poverty;review;systematic review;thermoregulation;Cold Temperature;Hot Temperature;Temperature,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

The Chesapeake Regional Information System for Our Patients, Inc. (CRISP) is a Health Information Exchange (HIE) linking disparate systems of care in the mid-Atlantic region. Methods: This article describes applications of HIE for tracking hospital service utilization in substance use disorder clinical and services research, drawing upon data from one of the first studies approved to access the CRISP HIE. Participants were 200 medical/surgical inpatients with comorbid opioid, cocaine, and/or alcohol use disorder (45.5 % female; 56.5 % black; 77.5 % opioid use disorder; 42.0 % homeless). This study compared HIE-identified hospital service utilization with conventional methods of participant self-report during in-person research follow-ups (3-, 6-, and 12-months post-discharge) and electronic health record (EHR) review from the hospital system of the index admission. Results: This sample exhibited high levels of hospital utilization, which would have been underestimated using conventional methods. Relying exclusively on self-report in the 12-month observation period would have identified only 33.8 % of 429 inpatient hospitalizations and 9.0 % of 1,287 ED visits, due to both loss-to-follow-up and failure to report events. Even combining self-report with single-system EHR review identified only 66.2 % of inpatient hospitalizations and 59.8 % of ED visits. Conclusions: CRISP HIE data were superior to conventional methods for ascertaining hospital service utilization in this sample of patients exhibiting high-volume and fragmented care. The use of HIE holds implications for improving rigor, safety, and efficiency in research studies.","L2005778142     2020-05-08     2020-05-19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.107992,alcohol;cocaine;opiate;adult;alcoholism;article;Black person;cocaine dependence;comorbidity;controlled study;drug dependence;electronic health record;emergency ward;female;follow up;health care utilization;homelessness;hospital admission;hospital discharge;hospital patient;hospital service;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;medical information system;opiate addiction;priority journal;self report;Substance-Related Disorders,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: This randomized, controlled trial enrolled 1026 18-64 year-old ED patients whose drug misuse indicated a needed for a BI. Differences in total Inventory of Drug Use Consequences (InDUC) scores between the treatment (BI) and control arms (no BI) were assessed every 90 days over a one-year period. Regression models were constructed to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with greater reductions in total InDUC scores. Results: Although total InDUC scores decreased for both the treatment and control arms, there were no differences in scores between the treatment and the control arms at baseline at each follow-up. In the regression analyses, participants who were not using drugs or received drug treatment in the past 90 days generally had lower InDUC scores at each follow-up. Conclusions: Although negative consequences decreased in both study arms over time, receiving a BI did not lead to a greater reduction in the negative consequences of drug misuse than not receiving a BI. Of importance in the design of future ED drug misuse interventions, participants who were successful in stopping their drug misuse or receiving drug treatment did show fewer negative consequences of drug use/misuse.","L609209963     2016-03-30     2016-04-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.10.007,"adult;article;brief intervention;clinical assessment;clinical effectiveness;controlled study;drug efficacy;drug misuse;drug program;emergency care;emergency health service;emergency ward;female;follow up;health care utilization;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;medical care;priority journal;randomized controlled trial;randomized controlled trial (topic);scoring system;social behavior;therapy;treatment indication;treatment outcome;Emergency Service, Hospital;Emergencies",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

METHODS: Healthcare databases were searched for studies quantifying the point prevalence for each outcome of interest. Searches were augmented by scanning of bibliographies and searches of governmental and non-governmental websites. Proportional meta-analyses were completed for each outcome. RESULTS: We found eight, six and five studies quantifying the point prevalence of major mental illness, substance misuse, and homelessness respectively. Considerable heterogeneity was found for each subgroup (except psychosis where substantial heterogeneity was observed) and random effects models were used to calculate pooled percentages. The pooled percentage for psychotic disorder was 3.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0-4.2%], for affective disorder 4.3% (95% CI 2.1-7.1%), for alcohol use disorder 28.3% (95% CI 19.9-37.4%), for substance use disorder 50.9% (95% CI 37.6-64.2%) and for those who were homeless on committal 17.4% (95% CI 8.7-28.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Estimates for the prevalence of psychotic illness and substance abuse amongst Irish prisoners are in keeping with international estimates of morbidity in prisons, whilst those for affective disorders are lower. The prevalence of homelessness in committal to Irish prisons is higher than some international estimates. Rates for psychoses, alcohol and substance misuse as well as homelessness in Irish prisons are significantly higher than the general population prevalence of these vulnerabilities.

Methods: Participants (N= 270) were recruited from a local drop-in center. Eligible youth met the criteria of homelessness as defined by the McKinney-Vento Act and abuse or dependence for Psychoactive Substance Use or Alcohol Disorder as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Youth were randomized to receive CRA (n = 93), MET (n = 86), or CM (n = 91). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months post baseline. Results: Growth mixture modeling analysis was conducted using MPlus 7 (MuthÃ©n and MuthÃ©n, 1998-2012). A three-class model fit the data the best. About half of the sample (n = 125) fell into the â€œfast decreasingâ€ class, 67 youth fell into the â€œslow decreasingâ€ class and 73 youth fell into the â€œincreasingâ€ class. Compared to those received CM, youth received CRA showed a lower likelihood of being in the â€œslow decreasingâ€ class than in the â€œfast decreasingâ€ class [b =-0.75, S.E. = 0.44, p = 0.085], and youth received MET showed a lower likelihood of being in the â€œincreasingâ€ class than in the â€œfast decreasingâ€ class [b =-0.70, S.E. = 0.41, p = 0.086]. Being African American [b = 0.17, S.E. = 0.08, p < 0.05] or female [b = 0.64, S.E. = 0.34, p = 0.059] increased the likelihood of being in the â€œslow decreasingâ€ class than being in the â€œfast decreasingâ€ class.

Additionally, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia had elevated positive and negative symptoms and were more likely to be male, single/unmarried, homeless, high inpatient service utilizers, involuntarily hospitalized, and to exhibit functional impairment at psychiatric hospital admission. To address elevated positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, functional impairment, social withdrawal, and high inpatient service utilization, promising psychosocial interventions should be adapted for racial and ethnic minority populations and utilized as an adjuvant to antipsychotic medication.","L2000842878     2018-06-19     2018-06-22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2018.05.043,"adult;African American;article;Caucasian;cohort analysis;diagnostic procedure;ethnic difference;female;functional disease;health care utilization;Hispanic;homelessness;hospital admission;hospital service;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;male;medical record review;mental hospital;mood disorder;priority journal;psychosocial care;psychosocial withdrawal;retrospective study;schizophrenia;sex factor;single (marital status);Schizophrenia;Mood Disorders;Hospitals, Psychiatric",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Of the 1825 participants, 47% had schizophrenia, 17.5% bipolar and 16.1% schizo-affective disorders. More women than men had undertaken post-school education, maintained relationships, and been living in their own homes. Women with a shorter-illness-duration showed social functioning equivalent to non-ill women in the general population. Men tended to have an early illness onset, show premorbid dysfunction, be single, show severe disability, and to use illicit substances. Men with a longer-illness-duration were very socially disadvantaged and isolated, often experiencing homelessness and substance use. Men with a short-illness-duration were most likely to be in paid employment, but two-thirds earned less than $AUD500 per fortnight. Men with longer-illness-duration showed most disability, socially and globally. Interventions should be guided by diagnosis, but also by a person's sex and duration of illness.","L616810971     2017-06-26     2017-06-30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2017.06.024,adult;article;Australia;bipolar disorder;clinical feature;demography;disability;disease association;disease duration;disease severity;disease surveillance;female;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;outcome assessment;population research;priority journal;psychosis;schizoaffective psychosis;schizophrenia;sex difference;social interaction;substance use;Psychotic Disorders;Sex Characteristics,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Using peer researchers, this study aimed to explore the perspectives of individuals with lived experience of MCN with regards to (i) issues leading to MCN and (ii) key intervention opportunities. Methods As part of a health needs assessment in Gateshead (North East England), trained peer researchers interviewed 27 adults (aged >= 18 years) with experience of MCN, identified using purposive sampling methods. Peer researchers designed a topic guide for interviews which were audio recorded and thematically analyzed. Results Interviewees reported adverse childhood experiences leading to MCN including abuse, bereavement, parental imprisonment, family break-up and inadequate support. Mental ill-health, substance use, poverty, early experiences of unstable housing and acute homelessness were identified as major precedents for adulthood experiences of MCN. Between 16 and 20 years, access to housing, social and mental health support was perceived as having the potential to prevent circumstances worsening. Individuals perceived removing barriers to mental health, housing and welfare and financial supports could help. Conclusions This study highlights the perceived role austerity, adverse childhood events and current service provision have in current and future experiences of MCN. Individuals expressed a need for future interventions and support to be judgement free and provided by workers who are educated about MCN and related adversity. Involving peer researchers and individuals with experience of MCN in future research and service provision could ensure appropriate measures and supports are put in place.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 4 Total Times Cited: 4 Cited Reference Count: 30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/eurpub/ckab142,Life Change Events,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women aged 20-39 years worldwide and women with SUDs have an increased risk of cervical cancer compared to women without SUD. The National Drug Treatment Centre (NDTC) cervical screening programme, derived from the national CervicalCheck programme, offers free cervical screening to patients attending for treatment of SUDs. AIMS: This study aimed to audit adherence to the NDTC Cervical Screening guidelines before and after the implementation of an awareness-raising educational intervention. METHODS: The electronic clinical records of women aged between 25 and 60 years attending the lead consultant's (M.S.) outpatient clinic were reviewed for documentary evidence indicating that information about the cervical screening programme had been discussed. This was completed before and one month after the implementation of an awareness-raising educational intervention. RESULTS: All women (n = 46, mean age 36.3 (SD = 6.5) years) had an opioid use disorder; 85% had a benzodiazepine use disorder, and 24% had an alcohol use disorder. Of these, 80% had at least one chronic medical condition, 76% had a psychiatric disorder, and 59% were homeless. Adherence to the NDTC cervical screening guideline, as indicated by documentary evidence in clinical records, was 33% (14/43) at baseline, and rose to 88% (36/41) (p < 0.0001) one month after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This completed audit cycle shows that an awareness-raising educational intervention can significantly improve adherence to a cervical screening programme in women with SUDs.","1863-4362     Haran, Maeve     Orcid: 0000-0002-2488-8927     Kelly, John R     Kennedy, Liam     Hennigan, Kieran     Farid, Huma     Herteu, Cristina     Kreisel, Anna     Salehin, Shamus     O' Sullivan, Marie     Keating, Shay     Ivers, Jo-Hanna     Scully, Mike     Journal Article     Ireland     Ir J Med Sci. 2021 Nov;190(4):1379-1386. doi: 10.1007/s11845-020-02459-1.

Mixed effects models examined the impact of community participation on quality of life. Results show that time in independent housing was significantly associated with several domains of quality of life. Symptom severity was also significantly and negatively related to quality of life domains. Community participation was significantly related to frequency of social contacts only. These findings suggest that community participation is not critical to improving quality of life, and that despite concerns that individuals may feel isolated and lonely when living independently, satisfaction with one's living situation and family relationships nevertheless improves with housing tenure.","L600271071     2014-11-04     2014-11-10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2014.07.072,adult;article;controlled study;disease severity;family relation;female;homelessness;housing;human;Likert scale;longitudinal study;major clinical study;male;mental disease;patient participation;patient satisfaction;quality of life;social behavior;structured interview;Student t test;Quality of Life,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: A rapid ethnographic approach was used to inform the recruitment of HIV-infected drug users into PPo and to describe the HIV cascade of care in a culturally and contextually situated manner. The fieldwork entailed participant observations of syringe exchange outreach to shooting galleries and other venues, over 35 informal conversations and 150+ encounters with members of the target population that were captured in detailed field notes and photographs and later analyzed for recurrent themes. Results: Many of the HIV-positive IDUs reported not receiving regular medical attention or adhering to an HIV treatment regimen because they felt â€œdiscriminated againstâ€ and â€œmarginalizedâ€ in clinic and hospital settings. They also face a myriad of challenges that hinder retention in HIV care including co-morbid conditions of substance use and mental health disorders, lack of social support, stigma and discrimination, and poverty-related issues such as unstable housing and food insecurity. Detoxification narratives were quite prominent with many of the street-based drug users commonly describing previous unsuccessful attempts and present desires to enroll in drug treatment programs but cited limited options and costs as key impediments. Conclusions: Efforts to address the HIV cascade of care in this population must also address social and structural forces that act as barriers to HIV prevention, care and treatment.","L71802286     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.301,Puerto Rico;drug use;drug dependence;college;Human immunodeficiency virus;population;hospital;field work;conversation;community;poverty;detoxification;clinical trial;substance use;mental health;diseases;social support;syringe;housing;food insecurity;prevention;narrative;drug therapy;photography;participant observation;human,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This study examined gender and racial differences among PWIDâ€™ sexual risk behaviors from the perspective of sexual scripts. Methods: 696 PWID enrolled from Philadelphia on HPTN 037 were classified as engaging in high-risk sex behaviors if they reported having sex in the past 30 days and condomless sex with a non-primary partner, giving/receiving sex for money, or multiple partners. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess associations between demographic factors and high risk sex. Results: Findings of the multivariable regression analysis demonstrated that being White (OR = 0.52, p < 0.001) and male (OR = 0.59, p = 0.002) were protective of high risk sex, while homelessness (OR = 1.7, p = 0.005), and being single (OR = 1.83, p = 0.006) were positively associated with high risk sex. African American (AA) women were 1.7 times more likely to report high-risk sex than AA men (p = 0.002), 3.28 times more likely than White men (p < 0.001), and 1.93 times more likely than White women (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Since AA women report high-risk sex behaviors more than other demographic groups, behavioral interventions for HIV risk reduction among PWID may benefit from focusing on sex-risk reduction among AA women.","L2000587969     2018-03-30     2018-09-25 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.11.018,adult;African American;article;Caucasian;controlled study;demography;drug abuse;female;high risk behavior;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;infection risk;injection drug use;male;priority journal;race difference;risk reduction;sex difference;sexual behavior;sexuality;Continental Population Groups;Sexual Behavior,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Using Bradshaw's (1972) classic taxonomy of needs as a framework, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between clients' expressed needs for their treatment experiences as compared to their formally assessed or normative needs. How expressed needs are related to demographic and other characteristics and program exit status was also explored. Methods: Secondary analysis of evaluation data gathered for other purposes was utilized. Data including demographic and drug use variables were obtained from client charts (N = 237) in a residential treatment agency serving women with co-occurring disorders who were homeless. Clients were administered the Addiction Severity Index-Multimedia Version (ASI-MV) to assess treatment or normative needs. They were also asked to complete the 69-item needs assessment questionnaire, What I Want From Treatment (Miller & Brown, 1994). Items that had the highest mean scores were submitted to a principal components analysis for data reduction to determine expressed needs. Bivariate analyses were used to determine the relationships between three expressed needs factors (alcohol/drug, psychological, and housing/employment) and ASI composite scores, demographic characteristics, and exit status. Results: There was no relationship between expressed needs and ASI scores except between the housing/employment factor and medical needs. Race, ethnicity, criminal justice status and drug of choice had no relationship to expressed needs. Those who were referred by a community agency had higher scores on the alcohol/drug factor as compared to those who were self-referred or referred by the criminal justice system. Clients receiving psychiatric medications were less likely to ask for help on psychological and housing/employment factors. There was no association between expressed needs at intake and program exit status. Conclusions: Race and supervision status did not appear to be barriers to asking for help. Clients' expressed needs were not related to the severity of their assessed problems, indicating that separate constructs were being measured. Including both expressed and assessed needs may be important in holistic treating planning and intervention.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 3 Total Times Cited: 3 Cited Reference Count: 29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Quality (Addiction),Psychiatric health condition - Substance misuse | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1080/15504263.2012.749164,expressed needs;client perspectives;substance use treatment;ADDICTION SEVERITY INDEX;SUBSTANCE-ABUSE;INITIAL VALIDATION;DRUG-TREATMENT;MENTAL-HEALTH;METHAMPHETAMINE;TRAUMA;WOMEN,,,N,N,Full text screen

A literature search regarding research into nursing clinical handover yielded multiple articles supporting these recommendation but no gold standard process identified yet. Many research methods were used to evaluate CH both qualitative and quantitative. A change to existing process was necessary to improve timeliness of process, increase efficiency and effectiveness of handover, reduce risk of errors associated with clinical handover, promote interaction during handover as per the national guidelines and to involve parents/patients in handover as per national guidelines A new 3 step CH process, based on the national guidelines and up to date research literature, was introduced on a surgical ward specialising in neurosurgery and craniofacial surgery in Temple Street Children's University Hospital, Dublin in Feb 2108 following an audit of previous practice. Subsequent audit and staff survey identified the benefits of the new process which has since been implemented by other wards in the hospital The new CH process has succeeded in implementing the national guidelines and is a quality improvement project that addresses patient safety, reduction in medication errors, improvements in metrics data, facilitates 'hello my name is', and use of the communication tool ISBAR 3. It improves communication with patients and families and also improves time management as nurses can finish on time and reduces by 50% the time a nurse is away from patients for handover. 1.

Survey-based studies have provided some information on the relation between alcohol and emergency department use among the homeless. Methods This study used an intensive schedule of random breath collections and self-report assessments to examine the relation between emergency department utilization and alcohol use in homeless alcohol-dependent adults. Data were from homeless alcohol-dependent adults (NÂ =Â 116) who were participating in a therapeutic workplace that provided job-skills training every weekday for 26 weeks. Breath-sample collections and assessments of self-reported alcohol use were scheduled each week, an average of twice per week per participant, at random times between 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. Participants received $35 for each breath sample collected. Self-reports of emergency department use were assessed throughout the study. Results Thirty-four percent of participants reported attending an emergency department and reported an average of 2.2 emergency department visits (range 1â€“10 visits). Alcohol intoxication was the most common reason for emergency department use. Participants who used the emergency department had significantly more alcohol-positive breath samples and more self-reported heavy alcohol use than participants who did not use the emergency department. Conclusions This study provided a rare intensive assessment of alcohol and emergency department use in homeless alcohol-dependent adults over an extended period. Emergency department use was high and was significantly related to indices of alcohol use.","L616790932     2017-06-21     2017-06-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.04.025,"alcohol;adult;alcohol consumption;alcohol intoxication;alcoholism;article;breath analysis;emergency ward;female;health care utilization;homeless man;human;major clinical study;male;priority journal;self report;Emergency Service, Hospital;Alcoholics;Emergencies",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

It is estimated that Ireland has a population prevalence of 0â€¢5-1â€¢2%(1). Injecting drug use remains a significant driver of the European HCV epidemic with estimates that HCV antibody prevalence amongpersons who inject drugs (PWID) in 29 European countries rangesfrom 5% to 90%(2).The study was conducted in two Phases. Phase One involved a scoping review of the key literature on screening and testing for HepatitisC among vulnerable populations. Phase two involved an analysis of adataset from the Hepcare Europe study. The dataset comprised of datafrom a cohort of PWID and a cohort of people who are homeless inCork. Eight key variables were identified and analyzed from thedataset which included, age, gender, HCV Ab result, previously testedfor HCV, history of injecting drug use, sharing of needles, and OpioidSubstitution Therapy.The scoping review identified injecting drug use as the most common riskfactor of HCV. Other risk factors include homelessness, mental illness, incarceration, tattooing and piercings. Analysis of the dataset showed 17.6%(N=193) of population tested were HCV Positive. 38.3% (N=193) reportedto have no previous history of injected drug use and 83.9% (N=193) reportedno history of sharing of needles throughout lifetime.While the results showed a low prevalence of HCV among participants, thismay be because of a greater awareness of harm reduction practices amongparticipants as indicated by low rates of needle sharing.","L626163408     2019-02-04 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Infectious Diseases - Hep/HCV | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No full text available,Systematic Review (studies included individually) | USER-NOTES: {""Carolyn""=>[""Abstract -- Full study results are likely available in the included studies!!""]}",10.1007/s11845-018-1941-8,virus antibody;adult;awareness;conference abstract;controlled study;data analysis;driver;epidemic;Europe;female;gender;harm reduction;hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;mental disease;needle sharing;nonhuman;prevalence;risk factor;tattooing;vulnerable population;Statistics as Topic,,,N,N,Full text screen

Hope, Public Health England, London, United Kingdom","Background: Infection risks among people who inject drugs (PWID) are known to vary by gender and there is also evidence of differences in risk by sexual orientation. However in the UK, risks among PWID who report same gender sexual partners have rarely been examined. Method: An annual unlinked-anonymous survey recruits PWID through drug services; participants provide a biological sample and complete a short questionnaire. Since 2011, dried blood spot samples and additional data on risk behaviours have been collected. Current injectors (injected during preceding 28 days) recruited during 2011-12 who reported having sex during the preceding year were included in the analyses. Those reporting same-sex partners were compared to those reporting only opposite-sex partners separately for men and women. Results: Overall, 1,591 men (incl. 81 men who reported sex with men [MSM], 5.1%) and 569 women (incl. 56 women who reported sex with women [WSW], 9.8%) were included in the analyses. The mean age of the men was 34 years and for the women 31 (age did not differ between those reporting same gender partners and those not). Of the MSM, 35 (43%) reported both male and female sexual partners, as did 40 (71%) of the WSW. Among the men, MSM were less likely to have injected opiates (81% vs. 89%, p=0.038) and to have been imprisoned (69% vs. 80%, p=0.021), and were more likely to report 10+ sexual partners (33% vs. 4.9%, p<0.001) and having transactional sex (37% vs. 5.8%, p<0.001). Among the women, WSW were more likely to have injected stimulants (63% vs. 46%, p=0.020), to report 10+ sexual partners (20% vs. 6.6%, p=0.002), to have ever had a voluntary confidential test for HIV (91% vs. 80%, p=0.041) or hepatitis C (93% vs. 83%, p=0.050), to report imprisonment (64% vs. 49%, p=0.029) and recent homelessness (54% vs. 36%, p=0.009). Among the men, MSM had a higher HIV prevalence (7.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001); none of the WSW had HIV. The anti-HBc and anti-HCV prevalence were not significantly different (but among the women, WSW had a raised anti-HCV prevalence, 55% vs. 42%, p=0.061). Discussion: Among PWID, infection risks and vulnerabilities are different for both WSW and MSM, indicating that these groups are at elevated risk of infections through both drug use and sexual activities. Targeted interventions to reduce risk among WSW and MSM who inject drugs are needed. Those providing services need to be aware of the elevated risks among PWID who report same gender sexual partners.","L71432074     2014-05-02 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/hiv.12147,central stimulant agent;hepatitis B core antibody;opiate;United Kingdom;human;gender;sexuality;sexual health;Human immunodeficiency virus;infection risk;male;female;risk;prevalence;dried blood spot testing;hepatitis C;questionnaire;sexual orientation;transactional sex;homelessness;sexual behavior;infection;drug use;Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section;Sexual Partners,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Data from the bio-behavioural surveillance of PWID in the United Kingdom were analysed to examine the impact of mephedrone injection on infections among PWID. During the year preceding the survey, 8.0% of PWID (163/2,047) had injected mephedrone. In multivariable analyses, those injecting mephedrone were younger, less likely to have injected opiates, and more likely to have injected cocaine or amphetamines, used needle/syringe programmes or sexual health clinics, been recruited in Wales and Northern Ireland or shared needles/syringes. There were no differences in sexual risks. Those injecting mephedrone more often had hepatitis C antibodies (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08â€“2.12), human immunodeficiency virus (AOR = 5.43; 95% CI: 1.90â€“15.5) and overdosed (AOR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.12â€“ 2.57). There were no differences in the frequency of injecting site infections or prevalence of hepatitis B. The elevated levels of risk and infections are a concern considering its recent emergence.

Opioid overdose is the primary cause of death among injecting drug users (IDU). Overdose is generally not sudden, occurs over one to three hours, and often in the presence of bystanders. This presents a unique window of opportunity to intervene. Aim. Successful overdose prevention training includes appropriate clinical and non-clinical responses. The study aimed to investigate Irish IDU experience of overdose, and need for education and resuscitation skills programming. We report on pilot findings. Methods. Phase One assessed service user experience of overdose, substances used, setting for overdose, and awareness of appropriate non-clinical responses (n=52). Phase two implemented an educational intervention at two Cork addiction service sites. This involved assessing service user awareness of appropriate non-clinical methods to manage overdose and their interest in receiving resuscitation training (n=26). Phase three piloted a resuscitation skills training intervention for staff, family and IDU consisting of instruction on how to recognise and prevent overdose, appropriate response techniques; rescue breathing, and calling emergency services (n=26). Results. The findings illustrated the majority had experienced overdose, described the main substances involved, the settings, the responses employed, and the perceptions of risk. The need for education equipping IDU with overdose prevention and management skills was identified. Awareness of appropriate responses (correct emergency numbers, recovery and resuscitation skills) improved following the educational and skills training interventions. Conclusions. Continued efforts in Ireland to integrate culturally specific overdose prevention into agonist opioid treatment services, prison discharge, homeless primary health and needle and syringe exchange are warranted.

Hotton, Department of Medicine, Chicago Center for HIV Elimination, University of Chicago, 5837 S. Maryland Ave, L-038, Chicago, IL, United States","Background: Among young people who inject drugs (PWID) homelessness is associated with numerous adverse psychosocial and health consequences, including risk of relapse and overdose, psychological distress and suicidality, limited treatment access, and injection practices that increase the risk of HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) transmission. Homeless PWID may also be less likely to access sterile syringes through pharmacies or syringe service programs. Methods: This study applied random-effects meta-regression to examine trends over time in injection risk behaviors and homelessness among young PWID in Chicago and surrounding suburban and rural areas using data from 11 studies collected between 1997 and 2017. In addition, subject-level data were pooled to evaluate the effect of homelessness on risk behaviors across all studies using mixed effects logistic and negative binomial regression with random study effects. Results: There was a significant increase in homelessness among young PWID over time, consistent with the general population trend of increasing youth homelessness. In mixed-effects regression, homelessness was associated with injection risk behaviors (receptive syringe sharing, syringe mediated sharing, equipment sharing) and exchange sex, though we detected no overall changes in risk behavior over time. Conclusions: Increases over time in homelessness among young PWID highlight a need for research to understand factors contributing to youth homelessness to inform HIV/STI, HCV, and overdose prevention and intervention services for this population.","L2012840835     2021-06-10     2021-12-03 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108797,adult;article;controlled study;female;homelessness;human;Illinois;injection drug user;major clinical study;male;needle sharing;risk behavior;sexual behavior;suburban population;trend study;urban population,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Aim: The aim of the study was to map the location of current injecting practices of people who inject drugs (PWID) in Cork, Ireland, and to document the related high risk behaviours, ahead of a planned supervised injecting facility. Methods: A cross sectional survey, utilizing geo-mapping software (GMS) mapping, was offered to PWID, at sites within the homeless services, needle exchange, and addiction services. Data was analysed using GPS mapping, and descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: 51 PWID completed the survey (98% response), 66.67% were male. The age range was 20-55 years (mean age 30.78 years). 56.9% were in stable accommodation, with 43.1% currently homeless. 92.16% had been tested for HIV/Hepatitis C. 31.5% reported injecting into ""high risk"" areas (groin and neck), 72.55% injected alone. 58.82% reported injecting at least three times/day, 35.29% reported injecting at least four times/day. 54.9% reported sharing equipment/needles. 58.82% had previously overdosed. 89.3% of recalled overdoses involved an emergency services response. Correlation between history of accidental overdose, and injecting alone was statistically significant (p = 0.039), as was previous history of overdose and injecting at least three times per day (p = 0.012). 86.27% indicated they would use a SIF. A mapping exercise presented visual information around injecting sites, locations of overdoses, fatal overdoses, and preferred location of the SIF. Conclusions: The study provides an understanding of PWID profile and risk behaviours, alongside a geospatial analysis of injecting, overdose and potential location of a SIF in Cork, Ireland. The findings are intended to inform SIF location, and would allow dynamic comparison of both geographic and behavioural changes injecting drug use over time, post SIF provision.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 2 Total Times Cited: 2 Cited Reference Count: 51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Quality (Addiction),Psychiatric health condition - Substance misuse",,Safe injecting facility;injecting drug use;location;PUBLIC-HEALTH;DRUG-USERS;FACILITIES;SYDNEY;VANCOUVER;OVERDOSE;ATTENDANCE;REDUCTION;COHORT;Ireland,,,Y,N,Included

We hypothesized that substance use and a history of traumatic brain injury would be associated with cognitive impairment. Methods We recruited 350 homeless individuals aged â‰¥50 years using population-based sampling and conducted structured interviews and neuropsychological testing. We evaluated alcohol use with the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, defining high-severity alcohol use as a total score â‰¥16 or â‰¥4 on the alcohol dependency sub-scale. We assessed global cognition with the Modified Mini-Mental State Test (3MS) and processing speed and executive function with the Trail Making Test (TMTB), defining impairment as performing 1.5 standard deviations below the standardized mean. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between alcohol use and cognition. Results Participants had a median age of 58 years [IQR 54â€“61], 76.7% were men, and 79.9% were African American. A quarter (25.1%) of participants met criteria for impairment on the 3MS; 32.9% met criteria for impairment on TMTB. In models adjusted for sociodemographic variables and health conditions, high-severity alcohol use was associated with global cognitive impairment (AOR 2.39, CI 1.19â€“4.79) and executive dysfunction (AOR 3.09, CI 1.61â€“5.92). Conclusions Older homeless adults displayed a prevalence of cognitive impairment 3â€“4 times higher than has been observed in general population adults aged 70 and older. Impaired cognition in older homeless adults could impact access to housing programs and the treatment of health conditions, including the treatment of alcohol use disorders.","L617474893     2017-07-27     2017-07-28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.06.002,adult;African American;aged;Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test;article;cognitive defect;cohort analysis;controlled study;disease association;disease severity;executive function;female;homeless person;human;major clinical study;male;middle aged;Mini Mental State Examination;neuropsychological test;prevalence;priority journal;structured interview;substance use;trail making test;traumatic brain injury,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Hostel staff were concerned about symptom management and drug safety. SPC staff were concerned about symptoms, compliance and family estrangement an implications for the patients completing life-work. Conclusions: The number of hostel dwellers referred to SPC is low. The needs are complex. Development of resources to support hostel staff, primary care teams and SPC providing care for this patient group has the potential to improve care.

The aim of this study was to reflect the prevalence of mental disorder within a subset of the homeless population in Dublin. METHOD: Long-term rough sleepers in Dublin were identified by the relevant non-statutory agency (Dublin Simon Community's Rough Sleepers Team). The authors attempted to assess all the identified individuals employing traditional clinical methods. RESULTS: We managed to assess 16 of the 22 identified individuals. We detected no formal disorder in ~30%, severe mental illness in ~30% and either alcohol or substance misuse in another ~30%. We detected dual diagnosis (co-occurrence of severe mental illness and alcohol or substance misuse) in 10%. CONCLUSION: Most but not all long-term rough sleepers in Dublin had a formal mental disorder identified. Just under one-third had a severe mental illness. This suggests that individualised patient centred health and social care will be required on a case by case basis in the long-term rough sleeping population.","2051-6967     Hynes, F     Kilbride, K     Fenton, J     Journal Article     England     Ir J Psychol Med. 2019 Mar;36(1):19-22. doi: 10.1017/ipm.2018.23. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Mental health condition",10.1017/ipm.2018.23,"*Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry);Homeless Persons/*statistics & numerical data;Ireland/epidemiology;Mental Disorders/*epidemiology;Psychotic Disorders;Substance-Related Disorders;*Vulnerable Populations;Homeless;mental disorder;mental illness;psychiatric illness;rough sleeping;Mental Disorders",,,Y,N,Included

This symposium addresses these knowledge gaps. Sloan describes the post-secondary outcomes of young adults with emotional and behavioral disorders. Using data from an American longitudinal epidemiological study, she illustrates the interplay of sociodemography, diagnoses and outcomes in youths who had psychiatric disorders by age 16. Healy presents an Irish community-based investigation of the effects of childhood psychotic experiences on global functioning. Compared to children who reported no psychotic experiences, those who did had poorer functioning that persisted into early adulthood. Notably, their underlying global vulnerability extended beyond diagnosable disorders. Henderson shows that NEET youths presenting at Canadian clinical and non-clinical services were likelier to have concurrent mental health and substance use concerns, legal troubles and crime/violence problems; be in unstable housing situations; and need welfare aid. Iyer paints a picture of NEET youths at a Canadian early psychosis program having longer prodromes characterised by unrelenting illness and plummeting premorbid adjustment. This, along with longer durations of untreated psychosis, suggests that NEET youths follow a distinct trajectory of clinical and functional decline. Finally, Cannon (discussant) will situate these findings within what is currently known about youth mental illness and functioning, and highlight their services, research and policy implications.","L624269340     2018-10-16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1111/eip.12722,adolescent;adult;adulthood;behavior disorder;child;conference abstract;controlled study;crime;diagnosis;education;employment;female;housing;human;juvenile;mental disease;mental health research;psychosis;substance use;tight junction;violence;welfare;young adult;Adolescent;Mentally Ill Persons,,,N,N,Full text screen

A cross-sectional survey of n=338 individuals in sheltered housing compared to a sample of patients at intake in acute inpatient psychiatry (n=619) concerning clinical and social variables was carried out in the catchment area of Zurich. Matched subsamples of individuals with schizophrenia (n=168) were compared concerning functioning and impairments on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS). Individuals with schizophrenia in sheltered housing (25% of the residents) have significantly more problems concerning substance use, physical illness, psychopathological symptoms other than psychosis and depression, and relationships, daily activities and occupation than patients with schizophrenia at intake on an acute psychiatric ward. Community sheltered accommodation although conceptualized to prevent homelessness in the general population de facto serve as housing facilities for individuals with schizophrenia and other severe mental illness.

In the era of HIV treatment as prevention (TasP), little is known about the prevalence and correlates of success along the HIV care continuum among people who use stimulants. Setting: San Francisco, California USA Methods: Cross-sectional study that enrolled 129 HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) from 2013 through 2017 who had biologically confirmed, recent methamphetamine use. Multivariable logistic regressions were built to identify correlates of success across the HIV care continuum. Results: Although two-thirds (87/129) of participants had undetectable HIV viral load (<40 copies/mL), only one-in-four (32/129) reported taking at least 90% of their antiretroviral therapy (ART). Those who were homeless in the past year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.06â€“0.65) had 80% lower odds of being undetectable and adherent to ART. Substance use disorder treatment was associated with 77% lower odds of being engaged in HIV care (aOR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.06â€“0.84) but also close to 3-fold greater odds of being adherent to ART (aOR = 2.91; 95% CI = 1.12â€“7.60). Conclusion: Despite the fact that many HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using MSM are able to achieve undetectable viral load in this sample, difficulties with ART adherence threaten to undermine the clinical and public health benefits of TasP. Expanded efforts to boost the effectiveness of TasP in this population should focus on meeting the unique needs of homeless individuals, optimizing ART adherence, and facilitating the integration of HIV care with substance use disorder treatment.","L2001120261     2018-10-01     2018-10-04 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.07.038,antiretrovirus agent;methamphetamine;adult;alcohol consumption;article;cross-sectional study;drug dependence;homelessness;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;major clinical study;male;men who have sex with men;multivariate logistic regression analysis;patient care;patient compliance;prevalence;priority journal;substance use;United States;virus load;Continuity of Patient Care;Methamphetamine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: We systematically reviewed articles from 1997 to 2012, that focused on US youth aged 12-18 in urban areas. Samples of youth who were incarcerated, in substance abuse treatment, or homeless were excluded. Results: We identified 39 unique articles that met review criteria. Just 10.3% of the articles focused specifically on marijuana use, whereas 51.3% considered marijuana along with other substances. The final 38.5% reported marijuana use prevalence, though marijuana was not a major focus of the study. More than half (53.8%) of the studies conducted analysis using cross-sectional data, 41% used longitudinal data, and 2% used other methods or a combination of both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Methods researchers used to assess marijuana use varied greatly. Of the 39 articles identified, 14 studies requested adolescents to report past 30-day marijuana use. Researchers recruited the majority of the participants in the selected studies in school settings (53.8%) and primarily included racial and ethnic minorities. Clinical based urban samples tended to report higher use of marijuana than school based samples, but this was not consistent or could not be comparatively determined due to variation in data collection methods. Conclusions: Overall, populations of urban adolescents report marijuana use at levels similar to the general population. There is still much to be understood about marijuana prevalence among urban adolescents; contextual geographical and community differences may impact marijuana prevalence more than other indicators.","L71802307     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.322,cannabis;lowest income group;juvenile;systematic review;college;drug dependence;cannabis use;human;adolescent;prevalence;population;scientist;urban area;school;community;data collection method;ethnic group;laryngeal mask;substance abuse;Cannabis;Adolescent,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

However, research on this topic is limited. We assessed trends in treatment admissions reporting injection, smoking, and inhalation abuse of prescription opioids and examined characteristics associated with non-oral routes of prescription opioid abuse in the U.S. Methods Prescription opioid abuse treatment admissions in the 2004â€“2013 Treatment Episode Data Set were used to calculate counts and percentages of prescription opioid treatment admissions reporting oral, injection, or smoking/inhalation abuse overall, by sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to identify demographic and substance use characteristics associated with injection or smoking/inhalation abuse. Results From 2004â€“2013, oral abuse decreased from 73.1% to 58.9%; injection abuse increased from 11.7% to 18.1%; and smoking/inhalation abuse increased from 15.3% of admissions to 23.0%. Among treatment admissions, the following were associated with injection abuse: male sex, 18â€“54 year-olds, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic other, homeless or dependent living, less than full-time work, living in the Midwest or South, â‰¥1 prior treatment episodes, younger age of first opioid use, and reporting use of cocaine/crack, marijuana, heroin, or methamphetamine. Conclusions The proportion of treatment admissions reporting prescription opioid injection and smoking/inhalation abuse increased significantly in the U.S. between 2004 and 2013. Expanding prevention efforts as well as access to medication-assisted treatment and risk reduction services for people who inject drugs is urgently needed.","L616272790     2017-05-26     2020-10-07 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.03.011,cannabis;cocaine;diamorphine;methamphetamine;adolescent;adult;age distribution;article;Caucasian;child;drug dependence treatment;female;full time employment;geographic distribution;homelessness;human;male;narcotic dependence;priority journal;sex ratio;trend study;United States;young adult;Prescriptions,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Health inequalities, particularly poor oral health, persist for those facing these inter-related issues and are closely linked with high levels of substance use, smoking, and poor diet. However, evidence for interventions that can improve these health outcomes for those experiencing these issues is limited. This paper outlines the design of a qualitative study which aims to explore the perspectives of stakeholders to understand what interventions can help to support SMD groups with their oral health and related health behaviours (i.e., substance use, smoking, diet). Interviews and focus groups will be undertaken with stakeholders comprising two groups: (1) individuals with experience of SMD, and (2) service providers (staff and volunteers), policy makers, and commissioners who support such individuals. Public involvement and engagement is central to the project. For example, stakeholders and research partners in policy and practice and people with lived experience of SMD will provide input at all stages of this study.

This paper applies Social Cognitive Theory to frame links between social factors and treatment outcomes among patients with social and economic disadvantages who are seeking MOUD at California Bridge Program (CA Bridge) hospitals. Methods: Electronic medical records for patients identified with OUD between January-April, 2020 receiving care at CA Bridge hospitals defined outcomes: hospital-administered buprenorphine; provision of buprenorphine prescription at discharge. Multi-level models assessed whether social factorsâ€”housing status, insurance type, and co-methamphetamine useâ€”predicted outcomes while accounting for group-level effects of treating hospital and controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and gender. Results: 15 CA Bridge hospitals yielded 845 patient records. Most patients received hospital-administered buprenorphine (58 %) and/or a buprenorphine prescription (55 %); 26 % received neither treatment. Patients with unstable housing had greater odds of hospital-administered buprenorphine compared to patients with stable housing. Patients with Medicaid had greater odds of receiving a buprenorphine prescription compared to patients with other insurance. Co-methamphetamine use was not associated with outcomes. Conclusions: Patients with OUD are successful in accessing same-day MOUD in CA Bridge hospital settings over a significant period. Importantly, access to MOUD in these settings was facilitated for patients traditionally not treated using buprenorphine, i.e., those with housing instability, Medicaid insurance, and co-methamphetamine use. Findings suggest barriers to MOUD for patients with social and economic disadvantages can be lowered by changing treatment delivery.","L2011498890     2021-03-31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108673,buprenorphine;methamphetamine;adult;article;California;controlled study;drug dependence;economic aspect;electronic medical record;ethnicity;female;gender;groups by age;health care delivery;health insurance;hospital discharge;housing;human;major clinical study;male;medicaid;middle aged;patient care;patient identification;prediction;prescription;priority journal;retrospective study;social aspect;treatment outcome;Buprenorphine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is classically considered a problem in neonates and puerperal sepsis. In 2018, Los Angeles county reported 62% Clindamycin resistance in GBS. A 32% reduction in GBS incidence in infants was recently reported from Germany. We studied 1321 isolates of Streptococci reported by our network labs from adults. GBS was the predominant isolate (481). Blood cultures were positive in 199. 175 were from urine and others were from wounds, tissue and body fluids. Group A was found in 80 blood cultures (BC), followed by S. anginosus 66, Group G 54, Group C 51, S. intermedius 31, S. constellatus 11 and S. dysgalactiae 3. Source of the blood cultures for majority of the isolates was lower extremity cellulitis. The commonest Streptococcal isolate from BC, urine, Soft tissue and joint fluid in adults was GBS. S anginosus incidence was higher than expected. A detailed analysis of all isolates will be presented.","L630644895     2020-01-23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.4269/ajtmh.abstract2019,clindamycin;adult;Alaska;blood culture;California;cellulitis;conference abstract;controlled study;developing country;England;female;Germany;Hong Kong;human;human tissue;incidence;India;infant;injection drug user;Ireland;lower limb;major clinical study;male;mental health;New Hampshire;newborn;nonhuman;puerperium;scarlet fever;sepsis;Singapore;soft tissue;South Korea;Streptococcus agalactiae;synovial fluid;tissue water;wound;Streptococcal Infections,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Many accommodation-based approaches have evolved across the globe to incorporate additional support and services beyond delivery of housing. Objectives This review examines the effectiveness of accommodation-based approaches on outcomes including housing stability, health, employment, crime, wellbeing, and cost for individuals experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. Search Methods The systematic review is based on evidence already identified in two existing EGMs commissioned by the Centre for Homelessness Impact (CHI) and built by White et al. The maps were constructed using a comprehensive three stage search and mapping process. Stage one mapped included studies in an existing systematic review on homelessness, stage two was an extensive search of 17 academic databases, three EGM databases, and eight systematic review databases. Finally stage three included web searches for grey literature, scanning reference lists of included studies and consultation with experts to identify additional literature. We identified 223 unique studies across 551 articles from the effectiveness map on 12th April 2019. Selection Criteria We include research on all individuals currently experiencing, or at risk of experiencing homelessness irrespective of age or gender, in high-income countries. The Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) contains all study designs where a comparison group was used. This includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental designs, matched comparisons and other study designs that attempt to isolate the impact of the intervention on homelessness. The NMA primarily addresses how interventions can reduce homelessness and increase housing stability for those individuals experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, homelessness. Additional outcomes are examined and narratively described. These include: access to mainstream healthcare; crime and justice; employment and income; capabilities and wellbeing; and cost of intervention. These outcomes reflect the domains used in the EGM, with the addition of cost. Data Collection and Analysis Due to the diverse nature of the literature on accommodation-based approaches, the way in which the approaches are implemented in practice, and the disordered descriptions of the categories, the review team created a novel typology to allow meaningful categorisations for functional and useful comparison between the various intervention types. Once these eligible categories were identified, we undertook dual data extraction, where two authors completed data extraction and risk of bias (ROB) assessments independently for each study. NMA was conducted across outcomes related to housing stability and health.Qualitative data from process evaluations is included using a ""Best Fit"" Framework synthesis. The purpose of this synthesis is to complement the quantitative evidence and provide a better understanding of what factors influenced programme effectiveness. All included Qualitative data followed the initial framework provided by the five main analytical categories of factors of influence (reflected in the EGM), namely: contextual factors, policy makers/funders, programme administrators/managers/implementing agencies, staff/case workers and recipients of the programme. Main Results There was a total of 13,128 people included in the review, across 51 reports of 28 studies. Most of the included studies were carried out in the United States of America (25/28), with other locations including Canada and the UK. Sixteen studies were RCTs (57%) and 12 were nonrandomised (quasi-experimental) designs (43%). Assessment of methodological quality and potential for bias was conducted using the second version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for Randomised controlled trials. Nonrandomised studies were coded using the ROBINS- I tool. Out of the 28 studies, three had sufficiently low ROB (11%), 11 (39%) had moderate ROB, and five (18%) presented serious problems with ROB, and nine (32%) demonstrated high, critical problems with their methodology. A NMA on housing stability outcomes demonstrates that interventions offering the highest levels of support alongside unconditional accommodation (High/Unconditional) were more effective in improving housing stability compared to basic support alongside unconditional housing (Basic/Unconditional) (ES=1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.39, 1.82]), and in comparison to a no-intervention control group (ES=0.62, 95% CI [0.19, 1.06]). A second NMA on health outcomes demonstrates that interventions categorised as offering Moderate/Conditional (ES= 0.36, 95% CI [0.03, 0.69]) and High/Unconditional (ES = 0.22, 95% CI [0.01, 0.43]) support were effective in improving health outcomes compared to no intervention. These effects were smaller than those observed for housing stability. The quality of the evidence was relatively low but varied across the 28 included studies. Depending on the context, finding accommodation for those who need it can be hindered by supply and affordability in the market. The social welfare approach in each jurisdiction can impact heavily on support available and can influence some of the prejudice and stigma surrounding homelessness. The evaluations emphasised the need for collaboration and a shared commitment between policymakers, funders and practitioners which creates community and buy in across sectors and agencies. However, co-ordinating this is difficult and requires sustainability to work. For those implementing programmes, it was important to invest time in developing a culture together to build trust and solid relationships. Additionally, identifying sufficient resources and appropriate referral routes allows for better implementation planning. Involving staff and case workers in creating processes helps drive enthusiasm and energy for the service. Time should be allocated for staff to develop key skills and communicate engage effectively with service users. Finally, staff need time to develop trust and relationships with service users; this goes hand in hand with providing information that is up to date and useful as well making themselves accessible in terms of location and time. Authors' Conclusions The network meta-analysis suggests that all types of accommodation which provided support are more effective than no intervention or Basic/Unconditional accommodation in terms of housing stability and health. The qualitative evidence synthesis raised a primary issue in relation to context: which was the lack of stable, affordable accommodation and the variability in the rental market, such that actually sourcing accommodation to provide for individuals who are homeless is extremely challenging. Collaboration between stakeholders and practitioners can be fruitful but difficult to coordinate across different agencies and organisations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 4 Total Times Cited: 4 Cited Reference Count: 151 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1002/cl2.1165,RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;ROBUST VARIANCE-ESTIMATION;INTENSIVE CASE-MANAGEMENT;HOUSING 1ST;MENTAL-ILLNESS;PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES;CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT;SUBSTANCE USE;HEALTH-CARE,,,N,N,Full text screen

The current study addresses this issue by applying a categorical method and critically examining the ideas of item inclusion and goodness of fit Data from 1527 subjects were used to test a proposed solution to the factor structure of the PANSS using a categorical factor analytic method. The model was made more generalizable by setting a minimum level of association between the item and the factor, and the results were then compared to existing solutions. The model was also tested for consistency in a first-episode sample. Use of categorical methods indicated similar results to previous analyses; however, it is demonstrated that the strength of the estimates can be unstable when items are shared across factors. The current study demonstrates that solutions can change substantially when a model is over-fitted, and therefore use of measures of fit as the criterion for an acceptable model can mask important relationships and decrease clinical validity.

D.",,eng,,"Trinity College Dublin, Trinity Centre for Health Sciences, Tallaght Hospital, Dublin 24.","The history of psychiatry is a history of therapeutic enthusiasm, with all of the triumph and tragedy, hubris and humility that such enthusiasm brings. During the 1800s and early 1900s, Ireland-s public asylums were routinely overcrowded, unhygienic and, quite commonly, fatal. The asylums became all-too-convenient options for a society with an apparently insatiable hunger for institutions, incarceration and control. The emergence of clinical professionals, both medical and nursing, was inevitably a factor in this complex mix, but the effects of any search for professional prestige were dwarfed by asylum doctors' clear outrage at what the asylum system became. There were powerful, non-medical, vested interests in keeping large asylums open. Irish society consistently failed to generate solutions to real human suffering (mental illness, disability, disease, poverty, ill fortune) other than the extraordinary network of institutions that characterised so much of Irish history: orphanages, industrial schools, reformatories, workhouses, laundries, borstals, prisons and asylums. As a result, Ireland's remarkable asylum system was primarily a social creation rather than a medical one. Notwithstanding this complex history, Ireland's mental health services have been transformed over the past five decades, although real challenges remain, especially in relation to the homeless mentally ill, the mentally ill in prison, and providing meaningful support to families.","Kelly, B D     Historical Article     Journal Article     Ireland     Ir Med J. 2017 Mar 10;110(3):537. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",,"History, 19th Century;History, 20th Century;Hospitals, Psychiatric/*history;Humans;Ireland;Mental Disorders/*history;Mental Health Services/*history/organization & administration;Psychiatry/*history",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Despite increased public and professional discussion, much remains to be done to provide effective, coordinated support to those at risk of suicide and those bereaved. In 2016, there were up to 300 different groups providing support. Clearly, a coordinated, effective and compassionate approach is needed, linking community and state resources meaningfully with each other.

Kelly, Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital, 200 Springs Road, Bedford, MA, United States","Background Long acting intramuscular (IM) naltrexone is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), but rates and correlates of its use have not been studied. Methods National administrative from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from Fiscal Year 2012 identified only 16 VHA facilities that prescribed IM naltrexone to 5 or more veterans diagnosed with OUD. Data from these facilities were used to identify sociodemographic, diagnostic, and service use characteristics, including use of psychotropic medication, that were characteristic of veterans who filled prescriptions for IM naltrexone. This was in comparison to users of opiate agonist treatments (methadone or buprenorphine) or veterans with no pharmacologic treatment for OUD. Comparisons were made using both bi-variate analyses and multivariable logistic regression. Results Only 179 of 16,402 veterans with OUD (1%) at these 16 facilities filled a prescription for IM naltrexone and only 256 of 99,394 (0.26%) nationally. These veterans were characterized by past homelessness, co-morbid alcohol use disorder, multiple psychiatric disorders, and a greater likelihood of psychiatric hospitalization, as well as mental health outpatient and antidepressant medication use. Conclusions IM naltrexone is rarely used for OUD and is primarily used for patients with multiple co-morbidities, especially alcohol use disorder and serious mental illness. The use of this treatment illustrates many of the principles identified by the emerging focus on multi-morbidity as a critical feature of clinical practice.","L619679440     2017-12-18     2018-09-17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.10.017,antidepressant agent;buprenorphine;methadone;naltrexone;psychotropic agent;adult;alcoholism;article;clinical practice;controlled study;cross-sectional study;demography;female;health care utilization;high risk population;homelessness;hospitalization;human;major clinical study;major depression;male;mental disease;mental patient;multiple chronic conditions;opiate addiction;outpatient;prescription;priority journal;veterans health;Ethnic Groups;Naltrexone,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

While older individuals are considered most at risk physically, evidence from the H1N1 and SARS epidemics showed that approximately 33.0% of quarantined children availed of mental health services due to anxiety and adjustment disorders highlighting the potential impact of a pandemic on paediatric mental health [2]. A prospective study was conducted exploring the impact of COVID-19 and the first national lockdown on paediatric mental health presentations to the Emergency Department (ED) at Temple Street Children's University Hospital (TSCUH). Materials and methods ED mental health presentations from March-April 2019 (n=79) and 2020 (n=60) were reviewed. Multiple variables, including reason for presentation, diagnosis and presence of self-harm (SH) and suicidal intent, were prospectively gathered for 2020 cases and compared to 2019 presentations. Descriptive analyses of clinical findings using T tests, chi-square tests and one-way ANOVA tests were performed as appropriate and statistical significance was considered with p < 0.05. Ethical exemption was granted by the chair of the local ethics committee. Results ED mental health presentations reduced by 24.1% in 2020 with a proportional increase in SH presentations (+8.6% (x2=1.03, p=0.31)) and reported suicidal intent (+39.2% (x2=15.04, p<0.001)). Proportions of re-presentations to ED increased in 2020, noting a 17.5% (x2=6.70, p=0.01) increase in those previously presenting with SH and a 43.6% (x2=25.88, p<0.001) increase in those previously presenting for other indications. Results show a 7.6% rise in attendance from care settings, with all children in care settings who presented to TSCUH ED in April 2020 citing COVID-19 to trigger ED presentation. More children presented with a family history of SH (+14.9% (x2= 4.75, p= 0.03)), those already prescribed psychotropic medication (+30.7% (x2=23.31, p<0.001)) and/or attending psychotherapy (33.3% (x2=15.01, p<0.001)) in 2020. A 22.1% increase in ED presentations with two or more diagnoses was observed in 2020 as well as changes in factors precipitating ED attendance such as arguments with family members (+9.8%), social isolation (+7.2%) and school pressure (-18.0%). Conclusions Our findings show fewer ED presentations during lockdown. Those who present are often high risk and known to services. Further research is needed to explore reasons for this in order to proactively manage vulnerable individuals in the community through effective service planning.","L635187014     2021-06-10 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1186/s12919-021-00213-8,"psychotropic agent;analysis of variance;automutilation;child;conference abstract;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;emergency ward;family history;female;homeless youth;human;major clinical study;male;mental health;national lockdown;professional standard;prospective study;psychotherapy;statistical significance;university hospital;Emergency Service, Hospital;Only Child;Child;Emergencies",,,N,N,Full text screen

Kerr, British Columbia Centre on Substance Use, British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, St. Paul's Hospital, 608-1081 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","Background: Esclating epidemics of fatal overdose are affecting communities across Canada. In many instances, the unanticipated presence of powerful opioids, such as fentanyl, in street drugs is a contributing factor. Drug checking offered within supervised injection services (SIS) is being considered as a potential measure for reducing overdose and related harms. We therefore sought to characterize the willingness of people who inject drugs (PWID) to use drug checking within SIS. Methods: Data were derived from a cross-sectional survey examining the feasibility of SIS in London, Canada, a mid-sized city. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with willingness to frequently (always or usually) use drug checking at SIS. Results: Between March and April 2016, 180 PWID were included in the present study, including 68 (38%) women. In total, 78 (43%) reported that they would frequently check their drugs at SIS if this service were available. In multivariable analyses, female gender (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 2.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: (1.20â€“4.46), homelessness (AOR = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.14â€“4.86), and drug dealing (AOR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.07â€“4.33) were positively associated with willingness to frequently check drugs at SIS. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of drug checking as a complement to other services offered within SIS, particularly given that subpopulations of PWID at heightened risk of overdose were more likely to report willingness to frequently use this service.

SETTING: Homeless services reporting deaths from homeless persons in their care across the Dublin Homeless Region. METHODS: Death data among people who experience homelessness was acquired from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (2011-2015) and validated from both death certificates and records from the Dublin Coroner's Office. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and nine deaths were recorded; of these 201 were verified (n=156 males, 77.6%). Deaths that could not be verified by certificate or coroners record were excluded from the study. RESULTS: SMRs were 3-10 times higher in homeless men and 6-10 times higher in homeless women compared with the general population. Drug and alcohol-related deaths were the leading cause of death, accounting for 38.4% of deaths in homeless individuals. These were followed by circulatory (20%) and respiratory causes (13%). CONCLUSION: Mortality rates among homeless persons are exceptionally high. Services and programmes, particularly housing and those targeting overdose and alcoholism, are urgently needed to prevent premature mortality in this vulnerable population.","2044-6055     Ivers, Jo-Hanna     Orcid: 0000-0001-7723-8787     Zgaga, Lina     O'Donoghue-Hynes, Bernie     Heary, Aisling     Gallwey, Brian     Barry, Joe     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     BMJ Open. 2019 Jan 25;9(1):e023010. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023010. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Mortality",10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023010,Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Alcoholism/mortality;Cause of Death/*trends;Drug Overdose/mortality;Female;Homeless Persons/*statistics & numerical data;Housing;Humans;Ireland/epidemiology;Male;Middle Aged;*Mortality;Retrospective Studies;Young Adult;homeless;standardised mortality ratios,,,Y,Y,Included

Kerman, School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","Background: People who inject drugs are highly vulnerable to social determinants of health (SDOH) inequities, such as homelessness, food insecurity, lack of social support, and poor access to healthcare. Supervised consumption sites (SCSs) have been developed to reduce harms associated with injection drug use but their social impacts remain largely unknown. This study explored service usersâ€™ experiences with SCSs and how their service use affected their SDOH. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study design was used. Participants were recruited from an SCS in Ottawa, Canada. Data were collected using in-depth interviews (n = 21). Data analysis involved two cycles of coding that were visibly presented in an analytic matrix. Member checking of the findings was then completed using two focus groups (n = 7). Results: Five themes were identified with regard to how SCSs impacted the SDOH: (1) social connectedness and community, (2) emotional support and stress reduction, (3) safety and security, (4) current shelter statuses and search for housing, and (5) health service access and use. The perceived effects of SCSs in these domains were mostly positive, though the importance of being vigilant and cautious when using the services was also expressed by participants. Conclusions: SCSs represent a potential downstream intervention to addressing some of the SDOH inequities experienced by people who inject drugs. In particular, the findings indicate that SCSs can be a bridge to rebuilding service usersâ€™ connections with the healthcare system and an important service in efforts to prevent unsheltered homelessness.","L2006047323     2020-06-05     2020-06-09 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108078,adult;article;Canada;data analysis;descriptive research;emotionality;female;health care access;health service;human;information processing;injection drug user;interview;male;personal experience;priority journal;qualitative research;safety;social determinants of health;physiological stress;study design,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Kerman, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 1051 Queen Street West, Toronto, ON, Canada","Background: Harm reduction is a central tenet of Housing First. As the intervention has been shown to stably house people experiencing chronic homelessness across the lifespan with complex behavioural health needs, it is critical to understand the harm reduction outcomes and practices in Housing First. Methods: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted of five databases: PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. Harm reduction outcomes and practices in Housing First were examined in four domains: substance-related harms, viral health, sexual health, and harm reduction service use. Results: A total of 35 articles were included in the review, 23 of which examined harm reduction outcomes and 12 of which investigated harm reduction practices in Housing First. Harm reduction outcome studies focused mostly on nonspecific substance use problems, with Housing First being found to have minimal effects in this domain. More severe harms, such as delirium tremens and substance use-related deaths, have been minimally explored, though preliminary evidence is promising. Viral health, sexual health, and harm reduction service use outcomes were the focus of few studies. Research on harm reduction practices highlighted that Housing First providers experience both flexibility and ambiguity in their work using a harm reduction approach, and the importance of empathetic working relationships for engagement in harm reduction work. Conclusions: Harm reduction outcomes in Housing First remain underexamined and any conclusions of the intervention's impacts in this domain would be premature. Effective harm reduction practices in Housing First require strong working relationships between staff and tenants.","L2014822080     2021-10-05     2022-02-15 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109052,data base;delirium tremens;disease severity;drug dependence;harm reduction;health care personnel;health service;health status;housing;human;human relation;mortality;outcome assessment;practice guideline;preliminary data;review;sexual health;systematic review;virus detection,,,N,N,Full text screen

Methods: Secondary data analysis of a 2013 community-based survey of transgender adults in Massachusetts (N= 452) was conducted. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were fit to examine the relationship of four risk factor domains with SUD treatment history and recent substance use: (1) demographics; (2) gender-related characteristics; (3) mental health; (4) socio-structural factors. Adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) were estimated. Results: Ten percent of the sample reported lifetime SUD treatment. Factors associated with significant increase in odds of lifetime SUD treatment alongside recent substance use (all p < 0.05) were: (1) older age (aOR = 1.02; 95% CI= 1.01-1.04), higher educational attainment (aOR = 3.59; 95% CI = 2.35-5.50), low income (aOR= 0.58; 95% CI= 0.39-0.86); (2) MTF identity (aOR=3.03; 95% CI= 1.95-4.67), gender-affirming medical care (aOR= 1.99; 95% CI= 1.32-3.00); (3) intimate partner violence (aOR= 1.68; 95% CI= 1.13-2.49), posttraumatic stress disorder (aOR = 2.56; 95% CI= 1.69-3.88), depression (aOR = 2.30; 95% CI =1.58-3.35), mental health treatment (aOR= 1.65; 95% CI =1.11-2.45); (4) discrimination (aOR = 1.90; 95% CI= 1.22-2.95), unstable housing (aOR = 1.80; 95% CI= 1.21-2.67), and sex work (aOR = 2.48; 95% CI= 1.24-4.95). Conclusions: Substance use and SUD treatment among transgender adults are associated with demographic, gender-related, mental health, and socio-structural risk factors. Studies are warranted that identify SUD treatment barriers, and integrate SUD treatment with psychosocial and structural interventions for a diverse spectrum of transgender adults.

This study investigates the health of this population, following the provision of a free to access primary care service for homeless people in Dublin (Safetynet). The health of this group will be compared to previous studies on homelessness conducted in Dublin prior to the establishment of this service (in 1997 and 2005). Methods: Participants were recruited through Safetynet clinics. A 133-item questionnaire was administered to determine participants' physical and mental well-being, use of health services and healthcare needs. Prescription data was extracted from participants' electronic health records. Results: A total of 105 participants were recruited. The majority were < 45 years of age (69%), male (75%), single (52%), Irish (74%) and had children (52%). Multimorbidity was common; with 5.3 Â± 2.7 (mean Â± SD) physical conditions reported per person. A large proportion of participants had at some point received a formal diagnosis of a mental health condition (70%; 73/105), including depression (50%; 52/105), addiction disorder (39%), anxiety (36%; 38/105), schizophrenia (13%; 14/105) and bipolar disorder (6%; 6/105). With regards to illicit drug use, 60% (63/105) of participants reported ever using drugs, while 33% (35/105) reported being active drug users. Based on AUDIT C criteria, 53% had an alcohol problem. Compared to previous studies, participants reported more positive ratings of health (70% vs. 57% in 1997 and 46% in 2005). The proportion of participants on one or more prescription medication was higher than in previous studies (81% vs. 32% in 1997 and 49% in 2005) and there was a decrease in attendance at outpatients departments (17% vs. 27% in 2005) and a trend towards a decrease in attendance at Accident and Emergency departments (A & E) (29% vs. 37% in 2005). Conclusions: This vulnerable population has many physical and mental health problems. Use of drugs, alcohol and smoking is common. Following the establishment of Safetynet, self-reported health was rated more positively, there was also a decrease in the use of A & E and outpatient services and an increase in prescription medicines.","Cited By :37     Export Date: 18 November 2022     Correspondence Address: Fahey, T.; HRB Centre for Primary Care Research, Department of General Practice, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, 123 St Stephen's Green, Ireland | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: General health,Health care - Use (Primary)",10.1186/s12913-015-0716-4,adult;comparative study;female;health care delivery;health service;health status;homeless person;human;Ireland;male;middle aged;patient attitude;primary health care;questionnaire;statistics and numerical data;Substance-Related Disorders;utilization;Health Services;Health Services Accessibility;Homeless Persons;Humans;Patient Acceptance of Health Care;Surveys and Questionnaires,,,Y,N,Included

Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology for scoping reviews. Suitable quantitative and qualitative articles were searched using PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases using a combination of keywords and a gray literature search was performed. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion. Inclusion criteria were studies that examined physical functional limitations and/or physical activity among homeless adults (with/without co-occurring mental illness, infectious disease, substance use disorder), as a primary or secondary outcome measure. Results: We identified 15 studies for inclusion including 2,018 participants. Studies were primarily quantitative (n=13) and there were 2 qualitative studies.Â The following outcomes related to physical functioning were reported; mobility levels (n=3), frailty (n=1), flexibility (n=2), strength (n=1), physical symptom burden (n=3), and exercise capacity (n=3). Eight studies reported outcomes related to physical activity. The majority of studies reported high levels of functional limitations among participants and low physical activity levels although a spectrum of abilities was noted. Conclusion: This review showed that many adults who are homeless appear to show a high burden of physical functional limitations and low physical activity levels but more objective and consistent measures should be applied to examine these factors in future studies. This will help address and plan future care, physical rehabilitation and housing needs for this vulnerable cohort. This scoping review will help direct research and future systematic reviews in this emerging area.","2515-4826     Kiernan, SinÃ©ad     Mockler, David     Orcid: 0000-0001-6171-8751     NÃ­ Cheallaigh, ClÃ­ona     Broderick, Julie     Orcid: 0000-0002-2572-6479     Systematic Review     Ireland     HRB Open Res. 2021 Mar 1;3:14. doi: 10.12688/hrbopenres.13011.2. eCollection 2020. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.12688/hrbopenres.13011.2,Functional status;homeless adults;homelessness;physical activity;Motor Activity,,,N,N,Full text screen

Providing people who inject drugs (PWID) with naloxone is essential to preventing deaths. However, research regarding gaps in naloxone delivery is limited. Methods: We interviewed 536 PWID in San Francisco and Los Angeles, California from 2017 to 2018. We described naloxone engagement and re-engagement cascades, and identified factors associated with receiving naloxone in the past six months and currently owning naloxone. Results: The engagement cascade showed 72 % of PWID ever received naloxone, 49 % received it in the past six months, and 35 % currently owned naloxone. The re-engagement cascade showed, among PWID who received naloxone in the past six months, 74 % used and/or lost naloxone, and 67 % refilled naloxone. In multivariable analyses, identifying as Latinx (aRR = 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.39, 0.72) and Black (aRR = 0.73; 95 % CI: 0.57, 0.94) vs White were negatively associated with receiving naloxone in the past six months, while using opioids 1âˆ’29 times (aRR = 1.35; 95 % CI: 1.04, 1.75) and 30+ times (aRR = 1.52; 95 % CI: 1.17, 1.99) vs zero times in the past 30 days and witnessing an overdose in the past six months (aRR = 1.69; 95 % CI: 1.37, 2.08) were positively associated with receiving naloxone in the past six months.

However, there is very little evidence on the effectiveness of Housing First in improving substance use-related outcomes in this population. This study uses a randomized control design to examine the effects of scatter-site Housing First on substance use outcomes in a large urban centre. Methods: Substance use outcomes were compared between a Housing First intervention and treatment as usual group in a sample of 575 individuals experiencing homelessness and mental illness, with or without a co-occurring substance use problem, in the At Home/Chez Soi trial in Toronto, Canada. Generalized linear models were used to compare study arms with respect to change in substance use outcomes over time (baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month). Results: At 24 months, participants in the Housing First intervention had significantly greater reductions in number of days experiencing alcohol problems and amount of money spent on alcohol than participants in the Treatment as Usual group. No differences between the study arms in illicit drug outcomes were found at 24 months. Conclusions: These findings show that a Housing First intervention can contribute to reductions in alcohol problems overtime. However, the lack of effect of the intervention on illicit drug problems suggests that individuals experiencing homelessness, mental illness and drug problems may need additional supports to reduce use.

Despite this evidence, and the increasing toll of opioid-associated morbidity and mortality, it remains controversial in some settings. To investigate the possible contribution of heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) to HIV treatment-related outcomes, we sought to estimate the proportion and characteristics of HIV-positive people who inject opioids that might be eligible for HAT in Vancouver, Canada. METHODS: We used data from a prospective cohort of people living with HIV who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada. Using generalized estimating equations (GEE), we assessed the longitudinal relationships between eligibility for HAT, using criteria from previous clinical trials and guidelines, with behavioural, social, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2014, 478 participants were included in these analyses, contributing 1927 person-years of observation. Of those, 94 (19.7%) met eligibility for HAT at least once during the study period. In a multivariable GEE model, after adjusting for clinical characteristics, being eligible for HAT was positively associated with homelessness, female gender, high-intensity illicit drug use, drug dealing and higher CD4 count. CONCLUSIONS: In our study of HIV-positive people with a history of injection drug use, approximately 20% of participants were eligible for HAT at â‰¥Â 1 follow-up period. Eligibility was linked to risk factors for sub-optimal HIV/AIDS treatment outcomes, such as homelessness and involvement in the local illicit drug trade, suggesting that scaling-up access to HAT might contribute to achieving optimal HIV treatment in this setting.","1940-0640     Klimas, Jan     Orcid: 0000-0002-5179-0052     Dong, Huiru     Fairbairn, Nadia     SocÃ­as, Eugenia     Barrios, Rolando     Wood, Evan     Kerr, Thomas     Montaner, Julio     Milloy, M-J     701698/European Commission (BE)/International     U01 DA038886/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States     R25 DA033211/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States     ELEVATEPD/2014/6/Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IE)/International     U01 DA021525/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States     R25 DA037756/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States     CAPMC/CIHR/Canada     Journal Article     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     Addict Sci Clin Pract. 2018 Feb 7;13(1):3. doi: 10.1186/s13722-017-0104-y. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s13722-017-0104-y,"Adult;Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects;Canada;Female;HIV Infections/complications/*drug therapy;Heroin/*therapeutic use;Humans;Illicit Drugs/*adverse effects;Middle Aged;Opiate Substitution Treatment/methods;Opioid-Related Disorders/complications/*drug therapy;Prospective Studies;Hiv/aids;Heroin;Illicit drug use;Opioid agonist treatment;Substance-related disorders",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

METHODS: We evaluated the impact of drug-related and other factors on discontinuation of MMT among persons enrolled in MMT and who reported any use of alcohol versus those who were enrolled in two community-recruited prospective cohorts of people who use illicit drugs (PWUD). Extended Cox models with time-dependent variables identified factors independently associated with time to first MMT discontinuation. RESULTS: Between December 2005 and 2015, 823 individuals on MMT who also reported using alcohol at least once were included in these analyses. During the study period, 391 (47.5%) discontinued methadone. Daily heroin injection (Adjusted Hazard Ratio [AHR]â€¯=â€¯2.67, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 2.10-3.40) and homelessness (AHRâ€¯=â€¯1.42, 95% CI: 1.10-1.83) were positively associated with MMT discontinuation, whereas receiving other concurrent addiction treatment in addition to MMT (AHRâ€¯=â€¯0.07, 95% CI: 0.05-0.08), as well as >60â€¯mg methadone dose (AHRâ€¯=â€¯0.48, 95% CI: 0.39-0.60), Hepatitis C virus seropositivity (AHRâ€¯=â€¯0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.90), and HIV seropositivity (AHRâ€¯=â€¯0.72, 95% CI: 0.57-0.91) were negatively associated with MMT discontinuation. Any/heavy alcohol use was not independently associated with MMT discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the known risks of continued heroin injection and homelessness for MMT discontinuation among individuals who also consume alcohol and highlights the protective effect of both MMT dose and receipt of concurrent addiction treatment.","1879-0046     Klimas, Jan     Nosova, Ekaterina     SocÃ­as, Eugenia     Nolan, Seonaid     Brar, Rupinder     Hayashi, Kanna     Milloy, M-J     Kerr, Thomas     Wood, Evan     R25 DA037756/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States     U01 DA021525/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States     U01 DA038886/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States     MSH-141971/CIHR/Canada     Journal Article     Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Ireland     Drug Alcohol Depend. 2018 May 1;186:182-186. doi: 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.01.027.

Kral, RTI International, San Francisco, CA, United States","Aims: As part of NIDA's Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain multisite initiative, we sought to evaluate whether a strengths-based case management intervention called Project Bridge Oakland (PBO) would help reduce HIV viral load for people who inject drugs (PWID) or smoke crack (PWSC) over a 2.5 year period. Methods: PWID and PWSC (N= 2424) were recruited in Oakland using targeted sampling methods from 2011 to 2013. HIV antibody positive participants who were not engaged in HIV care were enrolled in PBO intervention (n = 19) and compared to HIV antibody positive participants who were already engaged in HIV care (n = 29). All participants underwent blood draw for HIV viral load testing and a brief survey quarterly for 2.5 years. PBO involved a social worker and medical doctor using strengths-based case management principles to help link participants to continual HIV care, including advocating for HIV care as participants went in and out of jail. We used GEE repeated measures analysis of log-transformed HIV viral load to evaluate the relationship between viral load during follow-up and study arm. Because of the small sample size, we set the p-value cut-off at 0.10 for statistical significance a priori. Results: 63% of participants were male, 27% were female, and 10% were transgendered. 6% were 18-30 years old and 35% were 50 years old or older. 21% had injected drugs in the past 6 months. 67% were homeless. There was more reduction in log-transformed HIV viral load value since enrollment in the study for PBO participants than comparison participants (p = 0.0575). Conclusions: In this small quasi-experimental trial of HIV positive people who use drugs, enrollment in a strengths-based case management intervention appears to lower HIV viral load as compared to people in usual HIV care. PBO should be tested in a larger, multi-site RCT and may be useful for management of other infectious diseases like viral hepatitis.","L618520562     2017-10-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.306,Human immunodeficiency virus antibody;adult;blood;California;case management;clinical trial;communicable disease;controlled clinical trial;controlled study;female;follow up;hepatitis;human;Human immunodeficiency virus;major clinical study;male;middle aged;nonhuman;physician;sample size;smoke;social worker;statistical significance;viral load testing;Viral Load;Case Management,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Krawczyk, ICICT, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Aims: Calls to address rising crack-cocaine use in Brazil among homeless and street-frequenting populations who are in urgent need of health services have questioned the capacity of the Brazilian Unified Health System to attend to the nation's most marginalized citizens. In recent years, Brazil's federal government has launched several actions to increase public health services for drug users yet many obstacles hindering accessibility and effectiveness of such services remain. Somewhat paradoxically, these new policies have been implemented in the context of shrinking budgets and a growing economic crisis: The combination of expanding services for a population of poor and largely stigmatized drug users while cutting other essential government programs tends to elicit harsh political controversies and criticism from citizens. Precisely in consequence of such prospects, this paper aims to document the current deficiencies marginalized drug users face in accessing health services and their risk of worsening as the economic crisis leads to further cutbacks. Using Rio de Janeiro as a case study, we focus on two primary issues. First, the bureaucratic complexity of Brazil's network of public health services, and secondly, the pervading stigma that perpetuates mistrust, marginality and bars vulnerable citizens from official structures and services. Conclusions: Abandoning the initial efforts that have been implemented would be risking a return to the exclusionary discourse that has maintained vulnerable citizens at the margins of public structures, destroying the chance to offer such populations humane and urgently needed treatment and care.","L618520571     2017-10-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.307,Brazil;human;public health service;stigma;Health Services,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

In the absence of pan-European guidance on this issue, a position paper was commissioned by the European Pain Federation (EFIC). Methods: The clinical practice recommendations were developed by eight scientific societies and one patient self-help organization under the coordination of EFIC. A systematic literature search in MEDLINE (up until January 2020) was performed.Â Two categories of guidance are given: Evidence-based recommendations (supported by evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials or of observational studies) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) statements (supported either by indirect evidence or by case-series, caseâ€“control studies and clinical experience). The GRADE system was applied to move from evidence to recommendations. The recommendations and GCP statements were developed by a multiprofessional task force (including nursing, service users, physicians, physiotherapy and psychology) andÂ formal multistep procedures to reach a set of consensus recommendations. The clinical practice recommendations were reviewed by five external reviewers from North America and Europe and were also posted for public comment. Results: The European Clinical Practice Recommendations give guidance for combination with other medications, the management of frequent (e.g. nausea, constipation) and rare (e.g. hyperalgesia) side effects, for special clinical populations (e.g. children and adolescents, pregnancy) and for special situations (e.g. liver cirrhosis). Conclusion: If a trial with opioids for chronic noncancer pain is conducted, detailed knowledge and experience are needed to adapt the opioid treatment to a special patient group and/or clinical situation and to manage side effects effectively. Significance: If a trial with opioids for chronic noncancer pain is conducted, detailed knowledge and experience are needed to adapt the opioid treatment to a special patient group and/or clinical situation and to manage side effects effectively.

To date few solutions for homelessness include the input from key stakeholders (i.e. those who are homeless). Due to the multifaceted impact of homelessness, a systems lens is required to seek solutions. Design thinking or 'human-centred' approaches prioritize collaborative working and valuing user needs2 and feedback. This review considered the current evidence base for the use of design thinking interventions to address homelessness. A systematic scoping review of five databases (Pubmed, ASSIA, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycInfo) and grey databases (Open Grey and Google Scholar) was completed. The titles and abstracts of 1874 articles were independently screened by two reviewers using Covidence software and full-text screening of 103 papers was achieved. In total we include 9 studies for data extraction and a narrative review of emergent evidence is reported. Evidence from four countries: USA (5); Australia (2); Canada (1) and South Africa (1) was identified. Of the nine studies included, design thinking interventions were adopted for health, housing and employment solutions and included different population groups namely homeless families, youths and adults. Described interventions present evidence from early engagement of users to production of low fidelity prototyping with positive outcomes. Design thinking processes offer inclusive and collaborative methods2. Preliminary evidence from this review confirms the importance of engaging the experience of users i.e.'homeless populations' in seeking and developing solutions to empower and support their pathways out of homelessness.","L636025764     2021-09-24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1007/s11845-021-02718-9,adolescent;adult;Australia;Canada;Cinahl;conference abstract;data extraction;Embase;employment;female;homeless person;housing;human;human experiment;juvenile;male;Medline;narrative;population group;PsycINFO;search engine;software;South Africa;thinking;Thinking,,,N,N,Full text screen

This study aimed to identify predictors of PO injection initiation among PWUD, and examine trends in heroin use before and after initiating PO injection. Methods Data were merged from three cohorts of PWUD recruited between September 2005 and November 2015. Predictors of PO injection initiation were identified using extended Cox regression models. Trends in heroin use pre- and post-initiation were examined with McNemar's test and compared to matched controls with linear growth curve models. Results Among 1580 participants, 247 initiated PO injection yielding an incidence density of 3.9 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 3.4â€“4.4) per 100 person-years. In a multivariable analysis, independent predictors of PO injection initiation included heroin injection (Adjusted Hazard Ratio [AHR] = 4.39, 95% CI: 3.24â€“5.95) and non-injection PO use (AHR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.25â€“3.17). In a sub-analysis, compared to matched controls, PO injection corresponded with elevated heroin use post-initiation (p â‰¤ 0.05). Discussion In this study, heroin use and non-injection PO use strongly predicted PO injection initiation. Those who initiated PO injecting had elevated heroin use patterns post-initiation compared to controls. These findings suggest that transitioning to PO injection does not appear to be a substitute for heroin use among PWUD. These findings highlight the importance of addressing PO injection in harm reduction and treatment settings.","L612845346     2016-11-02     2016-11-14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.10.017,cannabis;codeine;diamorphine;fentanyl;hydrocodone bitartrate plus paracetamol;hydromorphone;illicit drug;methamphetamine;morphine;opiate;oxycodone;pentazocine;pethidine;prescription opioid;unclassified drug;adult;alcohol consumption;article;blood sampling;Canada;Caucasian;cohort analysis;controlled study;education;environmental factor;female;harm reduction;hazard ratio;heroin dependence;homelessness;human;incidence;major clinical study;male;opiate addiction;predictor variable;prescription;priority journal;prisoner;prospective study;sex difference;sexual abuse;social aspect;suicide attempt;trend study;United States;Prescriptions,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Lambert, Infectious Diseases, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland","Background and Aims: Peer support models are thought to be effective in engaging hard to reach individuals with Hepatitis C (HCV). However, whilst peer support is used on an 'ad hoc' basis by homeless and addiction community based services there is an urgent need to develop an evidence based peer support model to enhance access to the HCV care Pathway to ensure that those with the most significant disease are supported to get appropriate care & treatment Method: A community consultation process was initiated by the HepCare team and representation was sought from organisations with expertise in the needs of this particular cohort, in particular input from those with a lived experience of HCV. Through community collaboration & partnership a Peer Support model was developed between the study team & three key organisations along with a welcome commitment to deliver a twelve month pilot project in the community. Each organisation has nominated four HepFriend peer workers with a lived experience of HCV to volunteer on the project during the pilot phase, this gives a collective number of twelve HepFriend peer workers. Each peer will work with up to ten individuals giving capacity to work with one hun-dred and twenty individuals over the course of the pilot. The types of intervention carried out by the volunteers include support and information on the HCV care pathway; peer facilitated referral and attendance at clinical appointment if required. Peers received a 2 day training programme and certification upon completion. To date we have a number of instructive case reports to illustrate the value of the peer support intervention. In anticipation of the completed analysis of this project please see case report highlighted below. Results: On first hospital visit, following three DNA's (did not at-tend) Mary (37 years) tested 58 kPa on transient elastography exam with evidence of Child-Pugh B with significant clinical manifestations of liver disease. Mary was assigned a peer worker to ensure adherence to follow up and treatment. Mary was started on treatment within two weeks of her initial appointment and was supported by her peer worker to attend eight clinical appointments and successfully complete treatment and cure over a twelve week treatment duration.

However, in Ireland whilst peer support is used on an 'ad hoc' basis by homeless and addiction specific community based services there is an urgent need to develop an evidence based peer support model to enhance access to the HCV care Pathway to ensure that those with the most significant disease are supported to get appropriate care & treatment Theory/Method: A community consultation process was initiated by the HepCare Europe team and representation was sought from organisations with expertise in the needs of this particular cohort, in particular input from those with a lived experience of HCV. Through community collaboration & partnership a HepFriend Peer Support model for Dublin was developed between HepCare Europe & three key organisations along with a welcome commitment to deliver a twelve month pilot project in the community. Each organisation has nominated four HepFriend peer workers with a lived experience of HCV to volunteer on the project during the pilot phase; this gives a collective number of twelve HepFriend peer workers. Each peer will work with up to ten individuals giving capacity to work with one hundred and twenty individuals over the course of the pilot. The types of intervention carried out by the volunteers include support and information on the HCV care pathway; peer facilitated referral and attendance at clinical appointment if required. Peers received a 2 day training programme and certification through the Mater Misercordiae University Hospital in Dublin. To date we have a number of instructive case reports to illustrate the value of the peer support intervention. In anticipation of the completed analysis of this project please see case report highlighted below. Results: On first hospital visit, following three DNA's did not attend Mary 37 years tested 58 kPa on transient elastography exam with evidence of Child-Pugh B with significant clinical manifestations of liver disease. Mary was assigned a peer worker to ensure adherence to follow up and treatment. Mary was started on treatment within two weeks of her initial appointment and was supported by her peer worker to attend eight clinical appointments and successfully complete treatment and cure over twelve week treatment duration. Conclusion: Any planned intervention for HCV must engage many services and not just focus on treatment alone, making peer support a particularly important element in working with this vulnerable population. Lessons learned:This study suggests that peer support can enhance access and support individuals to navigate the HCV care Pathway. Limitations: Community based organisations have limited financial resources to implement peer support programmes Suggestions for future research: Scale up of HCV peer support model to ensure that those with the most significant disease are supported to get appropriate care & treatment.

Short description of practice change implemented: In the absence of consistent practice across the region where numerous screening tools, assessments and care-planning processes were being used in an ad-hoc manner, a standardised system of case-management and careplanning was implemented. Aim and theory of change: This initiative aimed to: (i) provide a continuum of care for service users across all addiction and homeless services across Southern Ireland and (ii) enable cooperative interagency working. Targeted population and stakeholders: Substance misusers Homeless Prisoners Irish Traveller Community Key stakeholders included statutory, community and voluntary organisations. Timeline: Since 2011, a 4-phased approach was taken: (i) exploration, planning and resourcing, (ii) implementing, (iii) operationalising, and (iv) business-as-usual (embedding), creating an integrated rehabilitation pathway. A regional case-management manual to support the process was adapted from the National framework, and in 2014, a joint assessment developed which satisfied both addiction and homeless sectors. Training was delivered to 190 frontline staff and 40 managers (28 agencies representing 75 diverse services). Highlights: (innovation, Impact and outcomes) This is the only region in Ireland to have integrated both addiction and homeless services inclusive of an Irish Prison. Co-ordinated shared care between services has resulted in a better quality service and enhanced access to health services for a hard to reach cohort of the population. Outcomes: reduced duplication of screening and assessment reduced assessment waiting times decentralisation of assessments from statutory clinics to the wider community Comments on sustainability: We designed a comprehensive implementation plan, reviewed iteratively by a multi-disciplinary team which represents the sectors described herein. This ensures fidelity to the integrated care framework. This consultation process continually informs how best to respond to successes and challenges in order to ensure sustainability. Comments on transferability: The continued work on this initiative provides a guiding framework that can be replicated in other regions and sectors. The pre- and postimplementation strategy employed to-date has proven to work with a heterogeneous population. Conclusions: (comprising key findings) To date this initiative has provided an integrated and coordinated care approach across two sectors inclusive of an Irish Prison. Integrated care across statutory, community and voluntary organisations has now been established in the region.

Lambert, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland","Background and Aims: Research previously undertaken identifies rates of HCV amongst homeless remains largely unknown. Due to increased risk taking behaviour, including injecting drugs and sharing equipment, there is a significant risk for transmission of Blood Borne Viruses (BBVs) predominantly through parenteral contact. Study Objective: to establish the effectiveness of intensified screening and support for Hepatitis C (HCV) in individuals attending homeless services in Dublin. Methods: Target Population: a cohort of homeless people accessing the Safetynet primary healthcare services in Dublin, Ireland Testing of this target population using the OraQuickÂ® Quantitative: audit of treatment outcomes in HCV positive patients identified during the screening process Qualitative: interviews with selected patients exploring the reasons they were lost to follow up after initial diagnosis Providing referral to specialty service with enhanced support including a community key worker linkage to secondary care Results: To date 460 have been screened for Hepatitis C, of whom 26% (n = 124) tested HCV positive, 9.60% (n = 12) represented new diagnoses, and 112 previously diagnosed but lost to follow up and/ or not successfully referred to specialty services. 72% were male, 28% female, 23% reported previous injecting drug use (IDU), 15% current IDU. 40 patients were referred for assessment to ID/hepatology services to assess suitability for HCV treatment. To date only 6 have attended despite key worker support. 45% (n = 18) of those referred have not attended. Reasons include active IDU -33% (n = 6), fear of biopsy and side effects of interferon treatment 16.6% (n = 3), inability to keep appointments because of chaotic lives from homelessness and staying in emergency accommodation 16.6% (n = 3), alcohol use 16.6% (n = 3), mental health issues 5.5% (n = 1), and incarceration 11% (n = 2). Conclusions: Opportunistic community based screening interventions such as oral HCV testing in Dublin have identified that 26% of the homeless population are HCV positive, most (90%) previously diagnosed but not accessing further evaluation and treatment. An immediate referral, even with enhanced services, failed to get this population to attend secondary services. A new paradigm of education, community assessment and community based â€œshared careâ€ treatment must be developed if we aim to allow this â€œvulnerable populationâ€ of homeless people to access curative treatments with the new interferon free direct acting HCV antivirals.","L72305668     2016-06-29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Conference Abstract,Health care - Access (Hep C),Infectious Diseases - Hep/HCV",,interferon;antivirus agent;liver;saliva;population;European;hepatitis C rapid test;community;human;screening;patient;follow up;hepatitis C;diagnosis;worker;clinical audit;mental health;alcohol consumption;high risk behavior;Ireland;homelessness;health service;side effect;biopsy;primary health care;fear;drug use;emergency;accommodation;secondary health care;virus;education;community assessment;blood;interview;male;female;vulnerable population;treatment outcome;risk;Saliva,,,Y,N,Included

Prevalence of HCV in homeless populations ranges from 3.9 to 36.2%. The HepCheck study sought to investigate and establish the characterisation of HCV burden among individuals who attended an intensified screening programme for HCV in homeless services in Dublin, Ireland. METHODS: The HepCheck study was conducted as part of a larger European wide initiative called HepCare Europe. The study consisted of three phases; 1) all subjects completed a short survey and were offered a rapid oral HCV test; 2) a convenience sample of HCV positive participants from phase 1 were selected to complete a survey on health and social risk factors and 3) subjects were tracked along the referral pathway to identify whether they were referred to a specialist clinic, attended the specialist clinic, were assessed for cirrhosis by transient elastography (Fibroscan) and were treated for HCV. RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-seven individuals were offered HCV screening, 73% were male and 63% reported having had a previous HCV screening. We screened 538 (90%) of those offered screening, with 37% testing positive. Among those who tested positive, 112 (56%) were 'new positives' and 44% were 'known positives'. Undiagnosed HCV was prevalent in 19% of the study sample. Active past 30-day drug use was common, along with attendance for drug treatment. Unstable accommodation was the most common barrier to attending specialist appointments and accessing treatment. Depression and anxiety, dental problems and respiratory conditions were common reported health problems. Forty-six subjects were referred to specialised services and two subjects completed HCV treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the current hospital-based model of care is inadequate in addressing the specific needs of a homeless population and emphasises the need for a community-based treatment approach. Findings are intended to inform HepCare Europe in their development of a community-based model of care in order to engage with homeless individuals with multiple co-morbidities including substance abuse, who are affected by or infected with HCV.","1471-2334     Lambert, John S     Orcid: 0000-0001-5404-2415     Murtagh, Ross     Menezes, Dee     O'Carroll, Austin     Murphy, Carol     Cullen, Walter     McHugh, Tina     Avramovic, Gordana     Tinago, Willard     Van Hout, Marie Claire     Journal Article     England     BMC Infect Dis. 2019 Feb 7;19(1):128. doi: 10.1186/s12879-019-3748-2. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Quality (Hep C)",10.1186/s12879-019-3748-2,"Adult;Delivery of Health Care/*methods;Europe;Female;Hepacivirus/immunology;Hepatitis C/*diagnosis/epidemiology;Hepatitis C Antibodies/blood;Hepatitis C Antigens/blood;*Homeless Persons;Humans;Ireland/epidemiology;Male;Mass Screening;Prevalence;Surveys and Questionnaires;Hcv;Hepatitis C virus;homeless;Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland (reference number:;1/378/1656).

In schizophrenia, a non-negligible subgroup is incarcerated for capital and other crimes. Most studies that compared offender and non-offender patients with schizophrenia have only focused on male patients. With this study, we compared demographic and disease-related characteristics between 35 female incarcerated forensic patients (fSZ) and 35 female inpatients with schizophrenia (SZ). Basic clinical documentation and basic forensic clinical documentation revealed significant clinical and demographic differences between the two groups. Compared to SZ, fSZ were more severely clinically impaired, showing higher rates of comorbid alcohol and substance disorder, more suicide attempts, had more previous hospitalizations, and were younger at disease onset. Regarding demographic variables, fSZ showed a higher rate of unemployment and homelessness and had to rely more often on housing and legal guardianships compared to SZ. These results suggest that female forensic patients with schizophrenia are more severely affected by clinical and non-clinical variables requiring an adapted intervention program.

This study aimed to establish the effectiveness of intensified screening for HCV in individuals attending homelessness services in Dublin. Methods: The target population was homeless people accessing the Safetynet primary healthcare services in Dublin. Individuals were invited to undertake a short questionnaire and HCV antibody test. Qualitative interviews were also carried out with selected patients (n=49) exploring a broader range of health and lifestyle issues. Results: 619 individuals were offered screening, of which 216 reported having had a previous HCV test (108 positive, 108 negative and 29 unsure of the result). 547 HCV Ab tests were carried out with 38% (206) testing positive, 57% (310) negative and 6% (31) recorded as no result/awaiting result. Of the 206 testing positive, 54% (112) were ""new"" positives, in that they did not report having had a previous positive HCV AB test, while the remaining were ""known positives"". Following a positive test, 51 patients were referred to specialist care of which 33 did not attend. The most common reasons for non-attendance were active on-going drug use, being in prison, fear of side effects of treatment and forgetfulness. Asked about barriers to treatment, participants' answers centred around on-going drug use, mental health issues and lack of stable accommodation. Conclusions: Community based screening interventions are effective in determining the prevalence of HCV in homeless populations however, referrals to secondary care are suboptimal for this cohort. The HepCheck study was carried out during a homelessness crisis in Dublin. Sourcing accommodation on a nightly basis was an unfortunate reality for many of the participants, with many additionally experiencing addiction and mental health issues. Considering the range and magnitude of barriers faced by this cohort in accessing hospitalbased services, outreach community based treatment provision alongside effective referral into onward care is the primary goal for HCV screening and treatment, in order for this hard to reach group to receive the treatment they need.

Laudet, NDRI,NYC, NY, United States","Aims: Substance use disorders (SUD) often start in adolescence, making this transitional period critical. Treatment is effective for youths but relapse is common. For youths in SUD remission wishing to attend college, the high rates of substance use on campus are a serious threat to continued sobriety. Collegiate Recovery Programs (CRPs) are an innovative model of campus-based recovery support that is growing exponentially but remains unexplored. Demographic and clinical information is lacking on students in CRPs and on their experiences with CRPs. Such knowledge can inform model development and evaluation. Methods: Data from an online survey of CRP students describes their background and clinical history, reasons for CRP participation, overall experiences with and use of CRP services. Results: Students (preliminary N= 480, target M= 550) from 25 universities in17 states were 56% male, Caucasians (91%) with an average age of 26; 12% were veterans. Drugs had been the primary problem for 58% (42% alcohol). Over half (59%) had been charged with a crime and 33% had had a period of homelessness; 82% had been in addiction treatment, 93% had attended 12-steps. Although substance-free, a minority engage in other addictive behaviors at a problematic level (e.g., 12% each compulsive eating and sex/love addiction past 90 days); 41% smoke and 66% are being treated for a mental health problem. CRP enrollment duration ranged from 1 to 8 semesters; top referral sources are word of mouth (29%), treatment (22%) and 12-step groups (12%). One third of students said they would not be in college right now were it not for the CRP and 60% find the CRP quite a bit or extremely helpful to their recovery. Conclusions: CRP students experienced severe consequences of their SUD; CRPs may promote college attendance in recovery. Further information is needed on compulsive behavior patterns in recovery to promote healthy functioning.","L71802363     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.378,alcohol;human;college;drug dependence;student;addiction;juvenile;model;cardiac resynchronization therapy device;smoke;substance use;eating;homelessness;remission;adolescence;crime;behavior;relapse;veteran;mental health;male;compulsion;university;substance abuse,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

In the current study, we investigated the association between service characteristics (i.e., the availability of training and supervision and the capabilityâ€fostering approach) and social service providers' work engagement and burnout. The study involved 497 social service providers working in homeless services in eight different European countries (62% women; mean age = 40.73, SD = 10.45) and was part of the Horizon 2020 European study ""Homelessness as Unfairness (HOME_EU)."" Using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), findings showed that the availability of training and supervision were positively associated with providers' work engagement and negatively associated with burnout. However, results varied based on the perceived usefulness of the training and supervision provided within the service and the specific outcome considered. The most consistent finding was the association between the degree to which a service promotes users' capabilities and all the aspects of providers' wellâ€being analyzed. Results are discussed in relation to their implications for how configuration of homeless services can promote social service providers' wellâ€being and highâ€quality care. Highlights: The complexity of users' characteristics can make working with homeless people very stressful.Some features of homeless services are likely to be associated with providers' wellâ€being.Useful training was associated with higher levels of work engagement and lower levels of burnout.Non useful supervision was positively associated with providers' burnout.Capabilityâ€fostering approach was positively associated with providers' wellâ€being.

Lerch, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, United States","Aims: Probation supervision is designed to motivate drug users to suppress illicit substance use during supervision. The probation suppression effect has not been adequately tested. This study examines predictors of continued illicit substance use among probationers in two urban areas. Methods: 142 substance-using probationers participating in an ongoing randomized control trial. Probationers completed baseline and 2-month follow-up (2MFU) interviews. Probationers averaged 37 years old and were predominately male (72.5%) and African- American (68.9%). The measures examined include age, criminal justice (e.g., lifetime arrests), treatment/use (e.g., recent hard drug use), and psychosocial (e.g., problem recognition) factors. Hard drug use includes opiates, cocaine, barbiturates, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and inhalants, which are statistically significant independent predictors of criminal behavior. Bivariate correlations and logistic regression models examined the relationship between individual factors and continued drug use (any) and hard drug use. Results: Bivariate analysis revealed homelessness, recent polysubstance use, recent hard drug use, substance use with family members, and peer substance use were associated with2MFUoverall drug use. Prior substance abuse treatment, age of first drug use, recent poly-substance use, recent hard drug use, lifetime hard drug use, problem recognition, and substance use with family were associated with 2MFU hard drug use. Logistic regression results reveal that homelessness (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.0-9.6, p = .05) and recent hard drug use (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.1-6.4, p = .02) increased the odds of 2MFU drug use. Recent hard drug users (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.2-15.4, p = .02) had increased odds of 2MFU hard drug use. Conclusions: Probation has a limited suppression effect for people with severe substance use disorders. Recent hard drug use predicts future drug use and future hard drug use. The identification of probationers most at risk for failure due to continued substance use should assist probation agencies in targeting probationers for behavioral health services.","L71802373     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.388,opiate;barbituric acid derivative;cocaine;amphetamine derivative;psychedelic agent;college;drug dependence;substance use;drug use;probation;homelessness;human;logistic regression analysis;lifespan;substance abuse;follow up;criminal justice;African American;implantable cardiac monitor;criminal behavior;bivariate analysis;male;model;interview;risk;health service;urban area,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

People with HIV (PWH) are vulnerable to such disruptions, particularly if they have a history of substance use. We describe engagement in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for PWH during the pandemic. Methods: From May 2020 to February 2021, 773 PWH enrolled in 6 existing cohorts completed 1495 surveys about substance use and engagement in HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We described the prevalence and correlates of having missed a visit with an HIV provider in the past month and having missed a dose of ART in the past week. Results: Thirteen percent of people missed an HIV visit in the past month. Missing a visit was associated with unstable housing, food insecurity, anxiety, low resiliency, disruptions to mental health care, and substance use including cigarette smoking, hazardous alcohol use, cocaine, and cannabis use. Nineteen percent of people reported missing at least one dose of ART in the week prior to their survey. Missing a dose of ART was associated with being a man, low resiliency, disruptions to mental health care, cigarette smoking, hazardous alcohol use, cocaine, and cannabis use, and experiencing disruptions to substance use treatment. Conclusions: Social determinants of health, substance use, and disruptions to mental health and substance use treatment were associated with poorer engagement in HIV care. Close attention to continuity of care during times of social disruption is especially critical for PWH.","L2017387979     2022-03-29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109355,adult;alcohol consumption;antiretroviral therapy;anxiety;article;attention;cannabis use;cigarette smoking;coronavirus disease 2019;depression;drug therapy;food insecurity;housing;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient;major clinical study;male;mental health;mental health care;pandemic;patient care;prevalence;social determinants of health;substance use;antidepressant agent;cocaine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods We conducted a cohort study of 2772 homeless patients discharged after an emergency admission at 78 hospitals across England between November 2013 and November 2016. For each individual, we selected a housed patient who lived in a socioeconomically deprived area, matched on age, sex, hospital, and year of discharge. Counts of emergency readmissions, planned readmissions, and Accident and Emergency (A&E) visits post-discharge were derived from national hospital databases, with a median of 2.8 years of follow-up. We estimated the cumulative incidence of readmission over 12 months, and used negative binomial regression to estimate rate ratios. Results After adjusting for health measured at the index admission, homeless patients had 2.49 (95% CI 2.29 to 2.70) times the rate of emergency readmission, 0.60 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.68) times the rate of planned readmission and 2.57 (95% CI 2.41 to 2.73) times the rate of A&E visits compared with housed patients. The 12-month risk of emergency readmission was higher for homeless patients (61%, 95% CI 59% to 64%) than housed patients (33%, 95% CI 30% to 36%); and the risk of planned readmission was lower for homeless patients (17%, 95% CI 14% to 19%) than for housed patients (30%, 95% CI 28% to 32%). While the risk of emergency readmission varied with the reason for admission for housed patients, for example being higher for admissions due to cancers than for those due to accidents, the risk was high across all causes for homeless patients. Conclusions Hospital patients experiencing homelessness have high rates of emergency readmission that are not explained by health. This highlights the need for discharge arrangements that address their health, housing and social care needs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 2 Total Times Cited: 2 Cited Reference Count: 32 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/jech-2020-215204,homelessness;access to hlth care;health inequalities;record linkage;HEALTH-CARE;RESPITE CARE;MORTALITY;DEATH;RISK;Patient Readmission;Cohort Studies;England;Inpatients,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Li, 10880 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1800, Los Angeles, CA, United States","Background: Men who have sex with men with histories of homophobic victimization bear heightened risk of unstable housing and methamphetamine use. However, it is unclear whether unstable housing explains the link between homophobic victimization and methamphetamine use in this group. The present study aims to test associations between homophobic victimization, unstable housing, and recent methamphetamine use across 24 months in a cohort of men of color who have sex with men (MoCSM). Methods: Our analysis stems from data of 1342 person-visits from 401 MoCSM participating in an ongoing cohort study. We performed a lagged multilevel negative binominal regression to test the association between past homophobic victimization and recent unstable housing, and a lagged multilevel ordered logistic regression to test the association between past homophobic victimization recent methamphetamine use. We then performed a path analysis to test whether recent unstable housing mediates the association between past homophobic victimization and recent methamphetamine use. Results: Findings showed homophobic victimization associated significantly with increased odds of unstable housing (IRR = 1.70, 95% CI [1.35, 2.14], p < 0.001) and recent methamphetamine use (OR = 1.40, 95% CI [1.15, 1.71], p = 0.001). Mediation analysis indicated that past homophobic victimization was indirectly associated with recent methamphetamine use via unstable housing (OR = 1.06 (95% CI [1.01, 1.11], p = 0.010). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that homophobic victimization and unstable housing should be addressed alongside treatment and prevention of methamphetamine use in MoCSM.","L2001129919     2018-10-01     2018-10-02 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.07.039,methamphetamine;adult;article;cohort analysis;disease association;disease burden;disease severity;drug use;health service;homophobia;housing;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;interview;major clinical study;male;men who have sex with men;priority journal;victim;Color;Methamphetamine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. Method: The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results: Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Conclusions: Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.","L2005558292     2020-04-20     2020-04-23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945,behavioral addiction;chronic disease;coronavirus disease 2019;Coronavirus infection;disease association;disease predisposition;exposure;health care access;health disparity;homeless person;homelessness;human;immunopathology;infection risk;letter;life expectancy;mental disease;patient isolation;physical disability;prevalence;priority journal;risk assessment;risk factor;SARS-related coronavirus;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;social distance;virogenesis;virus transmission,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: Participants of the EXposure Assessment in Current Time (EXACT) study were provided a mobile device for assessment of their daily drug use (heroin, cocaine or both), mood and social context for 30 days from November 2008 through May 2013. Real-time, self-reported drug use events were summed for individuals by day. Drug use risk was assessed through growth mixture modeling. Latent class regression examined the association of mHealth-defined risk groups with indicators of healthcare access and utilization. Results: 109 participants were a median of 48.5 years old, 90% African American, 52% male and 59% HIV-infected. Growth mixture modeling identified three distinct classes: low intensity drug use (25%), moderate intensity drug use (65%) and high intensity drug use (10%). Compared to low intensity drug users, high intensity users were younger, injected greater than once per day, and shared needles. At the subsequent study visit, high intensity drug users were nine times less likely to be medically insured (adjusted OR: 0.10, 95%CI: 0.01-0.88) and at greater risk for failing to attend any outpatient appointments (aOR: 0.13, 95%CI: 0.02-0.85) relative to low intensity drug users. Conclusions: Real-time assessment of drug use and novel methods of describing sub-classes of drug users uncovered individuals with higher-risk behavior who were poorly utilizing healthcare services. mHealth holds promise for identifying individuals engaging in high-risk behaviors and delivering real-time interventions to improve care outcomes.","L603966259     2015-04-28     2015-06-05 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.03.031,cocaine;diamorphine;illicit drug;methadone;adult;age;article;drug abuse;female;health care access;health care utilization;health insurance;high risk behavior;homelessness;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;major clinical study;male;mobile phone;mood;personal digital assistant;priority journal;sex difference;social behavior;treatment refusal;United States;Street Drugs,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: Among a cohort of 1405 current and former injection drug users in follow-up from 2005 to 2009, we used random intercept models to assess the temporal association between homelessness and subsequent injection drug use, and to determine whether the association between homelessness and sustained injection drug use among active injectors differed from the association between homelessness and relapse among those who stopped injecting. We also assessed the association between homelessness and subsequent injection-related risk behavior among participants who injected drugs consecutively across two visits. Homelessness was categorized by duration: none, <1 month, and >= 1 month. Results: Homelessness was reported on at least one occasion by 532 (38%) participants. The relationship between homelessness and subsequent injection drug use was different for active injectors and those who stopped injecting. Among those who stopped injecting, homelessness was associated with relapse [<1 month: AOR= 1.67,95% CI (1.01,2.74); >= 1 month: AOR =1.34 95% Cl (0.77,2.33)]. Among active injectors, homelessness was not associated with sustained injection drug use [<1 month: AOR= 1.03, 95% Cl (0.71, 1.49); >= 1 month: AOR= 0.81 95% CI (0.56, 1.17)]. Among those injecting drugs across two consecutive visits, homelessness >= 1 month was associated with subsequent injection-related risk behavior [AOR =1.61, 95% CI (1.06, 2.45)]. Conclusion: Homelessness appears to be associated with relapse and injection-related risk behavior.

Lipira, 800 NE Oregon St, Portland, OR, United States","Purpose: Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can be effectively administered by bystanders to prevent overdose. We determined the proportion of people who had naloxone and identified predictors of naloxone ownership among two samples of people who inject drugs (PWID) who use opioids in Portland and rural Western Oregon. Basic procedures: We used data from participants in Portland's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS, N = 477) and the Oregon HIV/Hepatitis and Opioid Prevention and Engagement Study (OR-HOPE, N = 133). For each sample, we determined the proportion of participants who had naloxone and estimated unadjusted and adjusted relative risk of having naloxone associated with participant characteristics. Main findings: Sixty one percent of NHBS and 30 % of OR-HOPE participants had naloxone. In adjusted analysis, having naloxone was associated with female gender, injecting goofballs (compared to heroin alone), housing stability, and overdose training in the urban NHBS sample, and having naloxone was associated with drug of choice, frequency of injection, and race in the rural OR-HOPE sample. In both samples, having naloxone was crudely associated with SSP use, but this was attenuated after adjustment. Principal conclusions: Naloxone ownership was insufficient and highly variable among two samples of PWID who use opioids in Oregon. People who use methamphetamine, males, and people experiencing homelessness may be at increased risk for not having naloxone and SSP may play a key role in improving access.","L2013721185     2021-07-29     2022-02-16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108912,diamorphine;methamphetamine;naloxone;opiate;adult;alcohol consumption;article;blood donor;disease transmission;drug efficacy;drug overdose;drug use;education;female;health insurance;hepatitis;homelessness;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;information processing;major clinical study;male;monitoring;opiate addiction;risk assessment;risk factor;sample size;training;Oregon;Naloxone,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Loomes, Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, Dublin, Ireland","Background: A 2018 study based on the 'Growing Up in Ireland' data published by Queally M. et al. identified that approximately 22% and 18% of mothers failed to recognise that their child was overweight/obese at three and five years of age respectively. Aims: 1. To calculate the body mass index (BMI) of children attending the Temple Street Emergency Department using the 'Measure Me' phone application. 2. To establish parental perception of their child's weight status. 3. To Identify discrepancies between the subjective and objective weight status and communicate this to the parents. 4. To provide educational information on healthy eating/further weight management options. Methods: Children aged two years or older attending the Emergency Department were identified. Parents completed a survey indicating the perceived weight status of their child. The height and weight of the child were recorded, and the BMI and standardised body mass index (BMI SDS) were calculated using the 'Measure Me' phone application and communicated to the parents. Children were offered a 'Healthy Ireland' food pyramid sticker. Parents of those overweight/obese children identified were provided with details to be referred onto Temple Street Hospital Outpatient Services for further weight management. Results: 101 children in total participated. 17.8% (18/101) were classified as overweight/obese, with a standardized BMI above the 91stcentile. Of those overweight/obese; 50% (9/18) of parents incorrectly identified their child to be of normal weight status. Of the parents who accurately identified their child as overweight (9/18), 77.8% (7/9) indicated they perceived their child to be 'mildly' overweight. Objectively 85.7% (6/7) of these were obese with a BMI SDS above the 95thcentile. In total 83.3% (15/18) of the overweight children had a standardized BMI above the 95thcentile. 83.3% (15/18) of overweight/obese children accepted educational information. Conclusion: In keeping with Queally M. et al.'s study a large proportion of children were objectively overweight/obese with a BMI SDS above the 91stcentile. However half of the parents failed to accurately identified their child's overweight/obese status. Although the remainder of parents accurately identified their child as overweight, a large proportion indicated that they perceived their child to be 'mildly overweight'. The vast majority of these children were obese with a BMI SDS above the 95thcentile. The high rates of parental acceptance of educational information would suggest a willingness to be further educated on weight optimization in children.","L628681935     2019-08-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1136/archdischild-2019-epa.987,"body mass;child;conference abstract;disease course;eating;emergency ward;female;height;homeless youth;human;Ireland;major clinical study;mother;obesity;outpatient care;perception;preschool child;university hospital;Emergency Service, Hospital;Only Child;Child;Emergencies",,,N,N,Full text screen

Lorvick, Urban Health Program, RTI International, San Francisco, CA, United States","Aims: To assess whether criminal justice (CJ) involvement is associated with increased socioeconomic vulnerability among women who use drugs. Methods: People who had smoked crack and/or injected drugs in the past 6 months were recruited using targeted sampling methods in Oakland, CA from 2011 to 2013. Participants (N= 2171) received rapid HIV testing and counseling and participated in a quantitative interview. For this analysis, we examined female participants only (n = 856). We defined CJ involvement as arrest, incarceration or community supervision (probation or parole). Results: CJ involvement was very high among women who use drugs in this community-based sample. Ninety percent of women reported lifetime CJ involvement and 30% reported CJ involvement in the 6 months prior to interview. Compared to women without CJ involvement in the past 6 months, recently CJ-involved women were more likely to be homeless (60% vs. 38%, p < .01), to trade sex for drugs (34% vs. 22%, p < .01), to have injected drugs (33% vs. 18%, p < .01) and to have experienced physical violence (38% vs. 22%, p < .01) in the past 6 months. Drug treatment utilization was slightly more common among CJ-involved women (19% vs. 13%, p = .05). In addition, HIV testing in the past 6 months was more common among CJ-involved women (30% vs. 16%, p < .01), although few of these women were tested in CJ settings. Conclusions: Women with recent CJ involvement were substantially more vulnerable to homelessness, violence and risky forms of drug use than their non-CJ-involved counterparts. Their participation in drug treatment and HIV testing was somewhat higher, although drug treatment utilization was quite low overall. Encounters with the CJ system should be used as opportunities to link women to stabilizing social services, such as drug treatment and housing.","L71802407     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.422,female;human;college;drug dependence;criminal justice;drug therapy;HIV test;interview;community;Human immunodeficiency virus;physical violence;lifespan;social work;probation;drug use;violence;housing;homelessness;counseling;sampling,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Among self-harm presentations generally, lethality of an index act is a poor predictor of future non-fatal repetition. However, no study has examined whether severity of an index self-cutting episode is associated with prospective repetition. Aims: To examine factors associated with severity of self-cutting and in particular the association between severity of self-cutting and prospective repetition of self-harm. Methods: All index self-cutting presentations to emergency departments in Ireland over 5 years were grouped by treatment received and compared on the basis of demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: Receiving more extensive medical treatment was associated with male gender, being aged more than 15 years, and not combining self-harm methods. Receiving less extensive treatment conferred a higher risk of prospective 12-month repetition, even after controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. Repeat self-harm presentations by those with more severe self-cutting in an index act were less prevalent but were more likely to involve high-lethality methods of self-harm. Discussion: The results indicate that the already-elevated repetition risk among self-cutting patients is further increased for those receiving less extensive wound closure treatment. Severity of self-cutting might also affect suicide risk but such an association has yet to be examined.

Methods: Participants were 185 PWID age 18â€“35 recruited from two sites of a large syringe service program in Chicago. After completing a baseline interview, participants used a mobile phone app to respond to momentary surveys on mood, substance use, and injection risk behavior for 15 days. Participants were assigned to receive surveys 4, 5, or 6 times per day. Results: Participants were 68% male, 61% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, and 5% non-Hispanic Black. Out of 185 participants, 8% (n = 15) failed to complete any EMA assessments. Among 170 EMA responders, the mean number of days reporting was 10 (SD 4.7), the mean proportion of assessments completed was 0.43 (SD 0.27), and 76% (n = 130) completed the follow-up interview. In analyses adjusted for age and race/ethnicity, women were more responsive than men to the EMA surveys in days reporting (IRR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.13â€“1.56), and total number of surveys completed (IRR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.18â€“1.93).

METHOD: A review of the data recorded by the National Drug-Related Deaths Index (NDRDI) was conducted to identify individuals who were known to be injecting at or around the time of their death, from 1998 to 2014. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2014, 16,500 deaths were recorded by the NDRDI. Of these, 792 (5%) people were known to be injecting at or around the time of death; 90% were poisoning deaths (n = 715) and 10% nonpoisoning deaths (n = 77). The majority of those who died while injecting were male (n = 682; 86%). Most people were living in Dublin city or county (n = 550; 69%). One fifth of those who died were homeless (n = 149; 19%). Opioids, specifically heroin, were implicated in the vast majority of injector poisoning deaths (n = 673; 94%), most commonly in association with polydrug use (n = 417; 62%). Single opioid poisoning resulted in 256 deaths (38%), and two fifths of those who died by single opioid poisoning were not alone at the time of death (n = 105; 41%). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to describe the trends in all deaths among drug users who injected at or around the time of their death in Ireland between 1998 and 2014.

Individuals in transitional housing programs often have a goal of reaching stable employment, but the unique needs and barriers for achieving re-employment among this diverse population (includes individuals that may be homeless, formerly incarcerated, or impacted by other stressful life circumstances) warrants further study to enhance programmatic and service recommendations. Methods A structured interview guide was developed and modelled after existing validated surveys. To evaluate the ability of the instrument to optimally measure the constructs of interest, cognitive interviewing was conducted to identify problems in comprehension, retrieval, judgement and response to survey questions so that the survey can be modified prior to full deployment. The survey was administered orally by one interviewer and audio recorded. Descriptive data analysis was done for this exploratory semi-qualitative study. Result Fifteen cognitive interviews were completed resulting in changes in content, wording, study inclusion criteria, and development of response categories. Over thirty interviews were conducted using the final guide. Results suggest that work histories of participants are more extensive with longer periods of employment than may be expected. Many respondents indicated that future employment goals include owning their own business and may represent an area of additional needed training for those currently unemployed. However, most aspirations for future employment were congruent with past achievements, including ownership. Discussion It is important to assess the needs and barriers of those seeking employment services to ensure programs deliver essential services. Ownership may help bypass some of the challenges faced with finding and maintaining employment due to criminal records or other barriers. This interview guide will be used in other populations seeking varied employment services from community organisations to further study needs and barriers for regaining employment.","L623947820     2018-09-24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/oemed-2018-ICOHabstracts.1457,achievement;adult;aspiration;community;comprehension;conference abstract;controlled study;data analysis;decision making;female;human;human experiment;information retrieval;interview;male;offender;oral drug administration;qualitative research;rehabilitation;unemployment;Employment,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

A multidisciplinary team including public health, homeless and addiction services undertook an investigation to identify risk behaviours and interrupt transmission chains. Recent HCV cases were defined as negative test within the previous year, or reported injecting for less than 1Â year; acute cases had tested negative within the previous 6Â months. Contacts in the injecting networks of cases were identified for testing. We undertook a cross-sectional survey using structured questionnaires to elicit risk behaviours for PWID and compare behaviours between self-reported hepatitis C positive and negative subjects. During the outbreak investigation until December 2017, 156 PWID were tested and 45 (29%) cases identified, including 7 (16%) recent and 13 (29%) acute infections. 68 PWID, including 12 cases, were interviewed. All respondents reported using heroin, with 76% injecting once or more daily. Sharing was reported for spoons (58%) and filters (53%), but also needles (27%) and syringes (29%). Hepatitis C positive individuals had higher odds to be injecting in public toilets (AOR 17, 95% CI 0.71-400, PÂ <Â .05) when compared with hepatitis C negative individuals. Hepatitis C positive individuals were more likely to inject in public spaces, but all respondents indicated concerning risk behaviours. We recommend active surveillance with ongoing testing, expanding existing harm reduction programmes and access to bespoke services.","1365-2893     Maisa, Anna     Orcid: 0000-0002-8372-7525     Semple, Susan     Griffiths, Alison     Ngui, Siew Lin     Verlander, Neville Q     McCaughey, Conall     Doherty, Lorraine     Jessop, Lucy     Outbreak Control Team     Historical Article     Journal Article     England     J Viral Hepat. 2019 Dec;26(12):1377-1387. doi: 10.1111/jvh.13184.

Manhapra, 100 Emancipation Drive, Hampton, VA, United States","Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a major risk factor for homelessness, but the specific association of opioid use disorder (OUD) and homelessness in the context of their shared risk factors has not been the focus of prior studies. We used national data from the United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to examine the association of OUD and homelessness in the context of shared risk factors. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis of veterans who received VHA care during Fiscal Year 2012 (N = 5,450,078), we compared the prevalence of OUD and other sociodemographic, and clinical factors among homeless and non-homeless veterans. We estimated the odds ratio for homelessness associated with OUD alone, and after adjusting for other factors through multivariate logistic regression. Results: Homeless veterans had substantially higher prevalence of OUD than other VHA patients (7.7 % Vs 0.6 %) and OUD was associated with 13 times higher unadjusted odds of homelessness (Odds Ratio [OR] 13.36, 95 % CI 13.09â€“13.62), which decreased with adjustment for sociodemographic factors (black race, mean income and age), other SUD, medical, and psychiatric diagnoses (final OR 1.57, 95 % CI 1.53â€“1.61). Other SUDs (alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, and hallucinogens) showed similar or slightly higher odds of homelessness as OUD in the final model. Conclusions: OUD was strongly associated with homelessness among US veterans although this association was largely but not entirely attenuated by shared sociodemographic and co-morbid risk factors including several other SUDs. Treatment of homeless veterans with OUD should address socio-economic vulnerabilities and other co-morbidities in addition to treatments for OUD.","L2011666070     2021-04-20     2021-07-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108714,cannabis;cocaine;opiate;psychedelic agent;adult;age;alcohol abuse;article;cannabis addiction;Charlson Comorbidity Index;cocaine dependence;controlled study;cross-sectional study;demography;disease association;ethnicity;female;gender;homelessness;human;income;male;opiate addiction;prevalence;psychiatric diagnosis;risk factor;social status;United States;veterans health;Ethnic Groups;Veterans,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

In the present mixed-methods study, the relationship of service providers' work-related values to their service users' recovery experiences in the microsystem of homelessness were examined. Service providers completed semi-structured qualitative interviews about their service users, daily work activities, and work-related goals. At three time points, their service users completed quantitative measures of choice, mastery, and recovery in four life domains: physical health, psychiatric symptoms, substance use, and community integration. Service providers' interview transcripts were coded for three indicators of values: assumptions, actions, and end-states. Summative Content Analysis was used to transform qualitative codes into numeric data so they could be used to predict service users' recovery. In a series of growth curve models, the extent to which service providers' end-state values, as an indicator of consumer-led values, was shown to indirectly predict service users' recovery experiences, through their perceived choice and mastery. Findings confirm that providers' values are an important influence on service users' recovery.

Homeless individuals endure many, or all, of these experiences. Previous research has shown that characteristics of homeless services, particularly the amount of choice they afford to service users, can influence recovery experiences, potentially by increasing a sense of mastery. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that choice in housing and services would predict recovery in a number of domains, and that these relationships would be mediated by mastery. METHOD: Using survey data collected from a sample of homeless services users (n = 160) in Ireland, we conducted a series of cross-sectional mediation analyses to predict recovery in domains of physical health, psychiatric symptoms, alcohol and drug use, and community integration. RESULTS: We observed the hypothesized mediational relationship for each recovery domain except alcohol use. That is, personal mastery mediated the relationship of perceived choice to self-appraised physical health, psychiatric symptoms, drug use, and physical and psychological aspects of community integration, but not alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Findings add further support to the growing body of evidence that suggests choice is centrally important to recovery experiences among individuals in homelessness.

Although mortality rates are low in Ireland, certain populations are more vulnerable to the associated morbidity and mortality of infection, particularly children with inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). Rotavirus can result in acute decompensation, lactic acidosis, liver dysfunction and death in this population. The aim of this study was to evaluate children with IMDs who had confirmed rotavirus and compare the investigations, management and outcome with controls with rotavirus. We aim to highlight the importance of introducing the rotavirus vaccination in this vulnerable population. Methods: Patients with confirmed rotavirus was obtained from the microbiology laboratory over the last 5 years in Temple Street Children's Hospital, Dublin. 14 patients with confirmed IMDs who were admitted with rotavirus were evaluated for details in terms of initial presentation, investigations and management. They were compared with 19 randomly selected age matched controls; children without IMDs who were also admitted with rotavirus infection. A retrospective chart review was conducted along with a review of the hospital laboratory system. Result: The median length of stay was 7 days in IMD patients versus 2 days in the controls. IV fluids were required on average for 4.57 days (SD 4.27) in IMD versus 1.05 days (SD 0.8) in controls. 2 IMD patients required a central line and 7 required total parental nutrition (TPN) compared to zero controls. Bloods were performed on average 8.53 times (SD 5.71) in IMD patients versus 2.5 times (SD 2.65) in the controls. Discussion: The rotavirus vaccination has been proven to be highly effective in reducing hospital admissions and mortality worldwide. As demonstrated in the IMD cohort, it leads to significant decompensation and morbidity in this population. The introduction of the rotavirus vaccine would offer additional protection to this vulnerable cohort.","L612078752     2016-09-14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1007/s10545-016-9969-2,Rotavirus vaccine;blood;central venous catheter;child;clinical article;controlled clinical trial;controlled study;homeless youth;hospital admission;hospital laboratory;human;length of stay;liquid;medical record review;metabolic disorder;microbiology;morbidity;mortality;nutrition;randomized controlled trial;Rotavirus infection;vaccination;vulnerable population;Only Child;Child,,,N,N,Full text screen

We tested the hypothesis that during the COVID-19 pandemic, refugees and other migrants have suffered a negative impact on mental health and have been unjustly discriminated for spreading the disease in Europe (data collection from April to November 2020). METHODS: Participants in the ApartTogether Survey (Nâ€‰=Â 8297, after listwise deletion of missing items final Nâ€‰=Â 3940) provided data regarding to their difficulties to adhere to preventive recommendations against COVID-19 infection (CARE), self-perceived stigmatization (SS), and psychological distress (PD). Structural Equation Modeling was used to investigate PD as a mediator in the pathway linking CARE to SS, while adjusting for the housing and residence status. To improve confidence in the findings, single hold-out sample cross-validation was performed using a train/test split ratio of 0.8/0.2. RESULTS: In the exploratory set (Nâ€‰=Â 3159) SS was associated with both CARE (Bâ€‰=â€‰0.200, pâ€‰<Â 0.001) and PD (Bâ€‰=â€‰0.455, pâ€‰<Â 0.001). Moreover, PD was also associated with CARE (Bâ€‰=â€‰0.094, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) and mediated the effect of CARE on SS (proportion mediatedâ€‰=â€‰17.7%, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). The results were successfully replicated in the confirmation set (Nâ€‰=Â 781; total effectâ€‰=â€‰0.417, pâ€‰<Â 0.001; proportion mediatedâ€‰=â€‰29.7%, pâ€‰<Â 0.001). Follow-up analyses also found evidence for an opposite effect (i.e., from SS to CARE, Bâ€‰=â€‰0.132; pâ€‰<Â 0.001), suggesting that there might be a vicious circle between the self-perceived stigmatization and the access to health care and the use of preventive measures against COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Refugees and other migrants who had more difficulties in accessing health care and preventive measures against COVID-19 infection experienced worse mental health and increased discrimination. These negative effects appeared to be stronger for those with more insecure housing and residence status, highlighting from one side the specific risk of insecure housing in the impact of COVID-19 upon mental health and infection protection, and for another side the need to proper housing as a strategy to prevent both COVID-19 and mental distress.","1471-2458     Marchi, Mattia     Magarini, Federica Maria     Chiarenza, Antonio     Galeazzi, Gian Maria     Paloma, Virginia     Garrido, RocÃ­o     Ioannidi, Elisabeth     Vassilikou, Katerina     de Matos, Margarida Gaspar     Gaspar, Tania     Guedes, Fabio Botelho     Primdahl, Nina Langer     Skovdal, Morten     Murphy, Rebecca     Durbeej, Natalie     Osman, Fatumo     Watters, Charles     van den Muijsenbergh, Maria     Sturm, Gesine     Oulahal, Rachid     Padilla, Beatriz     Willems, Sara     Spiritus-Beerden, Eva     Verelst, An     Derluyn, Ilse     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     BMC Public Health. 2022 May 11;22(1):942. doi: 10.1186/s12889-022-13370-y. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1186/s12889-022-13370-y,*covid-19;Europe/epidemiology;Humans;Pandemics/prevention & control;*Psychological Distress;Public Health;*Refugees;SARS-CoV-2;*Transients and Migrants;Covid-19;Mental health;Migrants;Social stigma;Discrimination (Psychology);Europe,,,N,N,Full text screen

Methods: We used self-reported questionnaire data collected semi-annually on PWID from Tijuana (n = 703) and Vancouver (n = 1551) between 2014 and 2017. Within each setting, the effect of recent (i.e., past six months) homelessness on recent provision of injection initiation assistance (i.e., helping anybody inject for the first time in the past six months) was estimated using inverse-probability-of-treatment (IPT)-weighted estimation of a marginal structural model. Results: Across follow-up, the prevalence of recent homelessness at a given visit ranged from 11.6%â€“16.5% among Tijuana-based participants and 9.4%â€“18.9% among Vancouver-based participants; the prevalence of recent provision of injection initiation at a given follow-up visit was lower, ranging from 3.3%â€“5.4% in Tijuana and 2.5%â€“4.1% in Vancouver. Based on the IPT-weighted estimates, recent homelessness was associated with 66% greater odds among Tijuana-based PWID (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.01â€“2.73) and 47% greater odds among Vancouver-based PWID (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.02â€“2.13) of providing injection initiation assistance over the same six-month period. Conclusion: We found that recently experiencing homelessness was associated with an increased likelihood of PWID reporting IDU initiation assistance over time in both Tijuana and Vancouver.

We sought to explore participants' experiences and views on a range of ORT options, and to explore experiences and perceptions of the acceptability and utility of LAB for this group. RESULTS: Twenty-nine people participated (8 women, 21 men) and described experiences of poor mental health and interaction with the criminal justice system, including prison. All had experience of ORT and some had a preference for the ""comfort"" of methadone while others liked the clear headedness of buprenorphine. Participants saw LAB as a valuable addition to the treatment options. Potential benefits included freedom from the challenges associated with daily dispensing and the freedom to be able to attend to their priorities and regain control over their day-to-day lives. LAB naÃ¯ve participants required reassurance regarding the duration of effect and wanted information and evidence from both their health care providers and their peers. CONCLUSION: Participants generally recognized the potential of LAB. The research team identified crucial themes for those experiencing homelessness: emotions, trust, and time. A move to LAB represents a shift in the locus of control to the individual, which, for some is exciting, but for others is daunting. Providers should address this shift in control, and it must to be central to joint decision-making on whether someone is ready for LAB, the information they require to help them decide, and the support they will require during treatment.","1873-6483     Matheson, Catriona     Foster, Rebecca     Schofield, Joe     Browne, Tania     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     J Subst Abuse Treat. 2022 Aug;139:108781. doi: 10.1016/j.jsat.2022.108781.

Helplines have been developed and widely implemented for specific use by young people. The current study aimed to systematically review the literature to determine the status of research into the use of helplines among young people. Method: Following the PRISMA checklist, 5 electronic databases were searched using relevant terms for literature published until May 2020. The extracted studies were summarized with the intention of identifying key themes that highlighted common findings, key implications, and important gaps in understanding. Results: A total of 52 articles fitting study inclusion criteria were identified. Most studies were quantitative papers from the United States and Australia. The types of helpline interactions studied were a mixture of telephone-based and SMS/text-based interactions. Three major themes were identified: awareness of and engagement with helpline services, nature of problems faced by young people, and service-related factors. Subthemes were use and awareness, barriers to help seeking, psychosocial problems, suicidality, telephone- versus text-based interactions, counselorâˆ’caller interaction, and provision of services to historically and systemically marginalized groups. Conclusion: It appears that helplines may provide a beneficial service to youths, and that myriad psychosocial concerns provide the basis for calling. The literature is limited by a lack of controlled trials, on one hand, and complex methodological/ethical barriers preventing such trials, on the other hand. However, more research is needed before conclusions regarding effectiveness in youths can be made, particularly for services provided to systemically marginalized groups and using online text-based approaches.

However, they have been underused in US minority settings. Objective: This study aims to examine the feasibility of assessing economic and sexual risk behaviors using text message surveys. Methods: We conducted a single-group study with 17 African-American young adults, aged 18-24 years, who were economically disadvantaged and reported prior unprotected sex. Participants received a text message survey once each week for 5 weeks. The survey contained 14 questions with yes-no and numeric responses on sexual risk behaviors (ie, condomless sex, sex while high or drunk, and sex exchange) and economic behaviors (ie, income, employment, and money spent on HIV services or products). Feasibility measures were the number of participants who responded to the survey in a given week, the number of questions to which a participant responded in each survey, and the number of hours spent from sending a survey to participants to receiving their response in a given week. One discussion group was used to obtain feedback. Results: Overall, 65% (n=11/17) of the participants responded to at least one text message survey compared with 35% (n=6/17) of the participants who did not respond. The majority (n=7/11, 64%) of the responders were women. The majority (n=4/6, 67%) of nonresponders were men. An average of 7.6 participants (69%) responded in a given week. Response rates among ever responders ranged from 64% to 82% across the study period. The mean number of questions answered each week was 12.6 (SD 2.7; 90% of all questions), ranging from 72% to 100%. An average of 6.4 participants (84%) answered all 14 text message questions in a given week, ranging from 57% to 100%. Participants responded approximately 8.7 hours (SD 10.3) after receiving the survey. Participants were more likely to answer questions related to employment, condomless sex, and discussions with sex partners. Nonresponse or skip was more often used for questions at the end of the survey relating to sex exchange and money spent on HIV prevention services or products. Strengths of the text message survey were convenience, readability, short completion time, having repeated measures over time, and having incentives. Conclusions: Longitudinal text message surveys may be a valuable tool for assessing HIV-related economic and sexual risk behaviors.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 1 Total Times Cited: 1 Cited Reference Count: 56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.2196/14833,HIV;sexual risk behaviors;homelessness;text messages;young adults;economic;mobile phones;Risk-Taking,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Baseline interviews were conducted with 40 young people, aged 1423 years, in 2004, and follow-up interviews were conducted with 30 research participants successfully tracked' in 200506. By the time of follow-up, 17 of those interviewed had exited homelessness and 13 remained homeless. The article focuses on the latter group with the aim of exploring the processes and experiences associated with their continued homelessness. The findings presented demonstrate the adverse impact of their ongoing movement through emergency services targeting the under-18s, including their greater immersion in drug and criminal lifestyles. A majority had experienced one or more period of incarceration by the time of follow-up, and many were users of adult homeless services. Whilst some dimensions of young people's accounts are suggestive of a process of acculturation to street and hostel life, we argue that their continued homelessness is better explained as a consequence of their ongoing and unresolved transience and, in particular, their continued dependence on emergency hostel accommodation. The implications of the findings for policy and service provision for homeless young people are discussed.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 12 Total Times Cited: 12 Cited Reference Count: 52 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: SDOH - Housing Needs",10.1080/13676261.2012.725837,homelessness;young people;remaining homeless;qualitative longitudinal research;Ireland;EXITING HOMELESSNESS;BIOGRAPHICAL APPROACH;YOUTH HOMELESSNESS;ADULT HOMELESSNESS;SUBSTANCE USE;RISK-FACTORS;IMPRISONMENT;POPULATION;DURATION;PATHWAYS,,,Y,N,Included

Mazhnaya, Department of Health, Behavior, and Society, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, 624 N Broadway, Baltimore, MD, United States","Background: In Eastern Europe and Central Asia new HIV infections occur at a high rate among people who inject drugs (PWID). Injection risk behavior may be associated with injecting in public places. However, there is a lack of studies exploring this association in Ukraine, which has an HIV prevalence 21â€“42% among PWID. Methods: Data came from a baseline survey of PWID recruited to participate in a behavioral HIV prevention intervention. The association between HIV/HCV injection risk behavior and place of injection (private vs. public) was assessed using multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance estimate. Results: Most of the sample was male (73%), > 30 years (56%), and reported opioids as their drug of choice (55%). One in six participants (15.8%, n = 57) reported using a syringe after somebody, and 70% (n = 253) reported injecting in public places within last 30-days. In the adjusted model, injection risk behavior was associated with injecting in public places (PrR: 4.24, 95% CI: 1.76â€“10.20), unstable housing situation (PrR: 2.46, 95% CI:1.26-4.83), higher than secondary education (PrR:1.82, 95%CI:1.04-3.16), injecting with a sex partner day (PrR:2.13, 95% CI:1.28-3.56), and injecting with a stranger (PrR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.93â€“2.31). Conclusions: Injecting in a public place is associated with increased prevalence of risky behavior. Therefore, understanding and addressing place-based context should be part of the national strategy to fight HIV and HCV in Ukraine. National programs would benefit from expanding models to include contextual and structural determinants of health.","L2000859404     2018-06-21     2018-10-19 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.04.036,central stimulant agent;opiate;adult;article;controlled study;drug dependence;educational status;female;health survey;hepatitis C;housing;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;infection risk;male;miscellaneous named groups;needle sharing;injection drug user;priority journal;public health;risk assessment;sexuality;Ukraine;Risk-Taking,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Gaps remain, though, in our understanding of how people who inject drugs (PWID) engage with naloxone programmes over time. Aims: This paper aimed to address three specific evidence gaps: the extent of naloxone supply to PWID; supply-source (community or prisons); and the carriage of naloxone among PWID. Materials and methods: Analysis of Scotland's Needle Exchange Surveillance Initiative (NESI) responses in 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 was undertaken with a specific focus on the extent of Scotland's naloxone supply to PWID; including by source (community or prisons); and on the carriage of naloxone. Differences in responses between the two surveys were measured using Chi-square tests together with 95% confidence intervals for rate-differences over time. Results: The proportion of NESI participants who reported that they had been prescribed naloxone within the last year increased significantly from 8% (175/2146; 95% CI: 7-9%) in 2011-2012 to 32% (745/2331; 95% CI: 30% to 34%) in 2013-2014. In contrast, the proportion of NESI participants who carried naloxone with them on the day they were interviewed decreased significantly from 16% (27/169; 95% CI: 10% to 22%) in 2011-2012 to 5% (39/741; 95% CI: 4% to 7%) in 2013-2014. Conclusions: The supply of naloxone to PWID has increased significantly since the introduction of a National Naloxone Programme in Scotland in January 2011. In contrast, naloxone carriage is low and decreased between the two NESI surveys; this area requires further investigation.","L608849528     2016-03-14     2016-05-02 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.02.031,naloxone;adult;article;drug dependence treatment;drug use;female;homelessness;human;male;injection drug user;prescription;priority journal;correctional facility;social welfare;United Kingdom;Naloxone,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This paper seeks to redress this imbalance and examines the experiences of women who have lengthy homeless histories based on the accounts of 34 women who are participants in a larger biographical study of homeless women in Ireland. Women's movements into and out of homeless service settings are examined in some detail, as are their accounts of the lived experience of prolonged homelessness. Their narratives reveal their mothering roles and identities, intimate relationships and intimate partner violence, and their ongoing interactions with institutional settings, including homeless hostels, as key dynamics influencing their movements and the strategies used by them as they attempt to manage their homelessness.

BACKGROUND: LGBTQ+ youth face many health and societal challenges including issues related to homelessness. DESIGN: A systematic review of qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies. METHODS: A search of relevant electronic databases was carried out and included the dates August 2008-August 2018 and limited to academic journals and peer-reviewed empirical studies written in English. Included studies specifically addressed the homeless experiences of youth aged 13-24Â years old who identified as LGBTQ+. The PRISMA checklist was used in the review. A quality assessment instrument was used to review all of the selected papers and narrative methods utilised in the synthesis of the research evidence. RESULTS: The search resulted in 319 papers, and after applying distinct inclusion criteria, a total of 14 papers were considered suitable for the systematic review. Following analysis, the four main themes identified were stigma, discrimination and exclusion; mental health issues and substance use; sexual risks and vulnerability; and interventions and supports. CONCLUSION: LGBTQ+ homeless youth is a major public health concern that has significant consequences for a young person's physical and psychosocial well-being. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Practitioners need to be aware of the specific health and support requirements of LGBTQ+ youth in relation to homelessness.

It is increasingly being recognised that addressing this global challenge requires effective cooperation between primary and secondary care and multidisciplinary approaches to care. As part of an EU project to integrate primary and secondary care for patients at risk of, or infected with HCV, we developed a Multidisciplinary Educational Masterclass Series for healthcare professionals working in primary care, in partner countries. This paper aims to describe and evaluate the series and examine how this model might be implemented in practice. Method: From local general practice, NGOs and Addiction Treatment Services, GPs/other healthcare professionals working in primary care were invited to eight one-day symposia (HCV Masterclass series) examining the burden of HCV, how to prevent new infections, why/how to screen, new approaches to diagno-sis/treatment, management of HIV/HCV co-infection in IDUs, and treating coexisting problem alcohol use. Peer-support sessions as training day programmes and flyers were offered to homeless people and IDUs. Results: Over 200 participants involved in HCV care in the com-munity from participating countries attended the Masterclass series. 100% of participants 'strongly agreed' or 'agreed' that the Masterclass helped them ""appreciate the role of primary care"" and ""secondary care"" in ""the management of patients with HCV"" as well as ""describing new approaches to assessment (Fibroscan)"" (97-100%) and ""treatment"" (88-96%) of patients with HCV especially in countries where the Interferon-free regimes were implemented more recently. In regards to making an integrated model of care happen in practice, 100% of participants indicated the importance of a ""designated nurse to liaise with hospital services"" and that ""educational programmes"" (91-100%) and ""computerised-decision making"" (88-92%) would also be of value. Patients from vulnerable groups were addressed also in 11 peer-support sessions and by distributing printed educational materials for high risk behaviour patients/HCV positive patients in waiting rooms at primary care facilities or emergency rooms of hospitals. Conclusion: This paper highlights the importance of integrated approaches to healthcare and addressing the educational level of the patients in optimising hepatitis C care in the community.","L622934704     2018-07-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Quality (Hep C) | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1111/jvh.241_12923,endogenous compound;interferon;addiction;adult;alcohol abuse;conference abstract;controlled study;decision making;elastograph;emergency ward;female;general practice;hepatitis C;high risk behavior;homeless person;hospital service;human;Human immunodeficiency virus;major clinical study;male;coinfection;nonhuman;nurse;peer group;prevention;primary medical care;risk assessment;secondary health care;waiting room,,,N,N,Full text screen

Provided that no ulterior motive is at play, the use of compulsory evacuations and relocations as policy responses to such risk is mandated by the duty to protect the right to life. However, proactive displacement in the interest of saving lives can be problematic as such measures can lead to the limitation of other human rights, resulting in an intricate assessment of whether compulsory evacuation or permanent relocation is proportional in any given circumstance. Such an analysis demands critical attention by public authorities to the perception of the disaster risk in question and problematises claims to objectivity of official risk assessments. Furthermore, it poses the question as to whether measures designed to address the disaster risk in question that are less intrusive than relocation may be available to public authorities.","1467-7717     McDermott, Ronan PhD     Gibbons, Pat PhD     Journal Article     England     Disasters. 2017 Jul;41(3):587-605. doi: 10.1111/disa.12217.

In the following weeks, most European countries implemented national lockdowns to mitigate viral spread. Services for people who use drugs had to quickly revise their operating procedures to rearrange service provision while adhering to lockdown requirements. Given the scarcity of literature published on overdose prevention during COVID-19 in Europe, we aimed to examine how these changes to service provision affected take-home naloxone (THN) programmes and naloxone availability across Europe. METHODS: Between November 2020 and January 2021, we conducted a rapid assessment with country experts from European countries that provide THN. We sent country experts a template to report monthly THN distribution data (January 1, 2019-October 31, 2020) and a structured 6-item survey for completion. RESULTS: Responses were received from 14 of the 15 European countries with THN provision of which 11 participated in the rapid assessment: Austria, Denmark, England, Estonia, Lithuania, Northern Ireland, Norway, Scotland, Spain (Catalonia only), Sweden, and Wales. All reported reduced organisational capacity during COVID-19, and some put into place a range of novel approaches to manage the restrictions on face-to-face service provision. In six countries, the introduction of programme innovation occurred alongside the publication of government guidelines recommending increased THN provision during COVID-19. Eight of the eleven participating countries managed to maintain 2019-level monthly THN distribution rates or even increase provision during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Through programme innovation supported by public guidelines, many European THN programmes managed to ensure stable or even increased THN provision during the pandemic, despite social distancing and stay-at-home orders affecting client mobility.","1873-4758     McDonald, Rebecca     Eide, Desiree     Abel-Ollo, Katri     Barnsdale, Lee     Carter, Ben     Clausen, Thomas     Day, Ed     Fonseca, Francina     HolmÃ©n, Elin     Horsburgh, Kirsten     Kelleher, Mike     KÃ¥berg, Martin     Ladenhauf, Martin     McAuley, Andrew     Metrebian, Nicola     Neale, Joanne     Parkin, Stephen     Ratcliffe, Kevin     Rintoul, Chris     Smith, Josie     Stifanoviciute, Viktorija     Torrens, Marta     Thiesen, Henrik     Strang, John     Journal Article     Netherlands     Int J Drug Policy. 2022 Sep;107:103787. doi: 10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103787.

Pregnancy rates among homeless women are exceptionally high compared to their housed counterparts and homeless women engage poorly with antenatal care. The aim of this review is to explore the barriers and facilitators perceived by homeless women, while pregnant, or within six weeks postpartum in accessing antenatal and/or postnatal healthcare. A qualitative systematic review and synthesis was conducted. Key words and search terms were derived using the SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type) framework. Titles and abstracts were screened in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria. The methodological quality of included papers was assessed using criteria described by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) with data analysis using thematic synthesis. Two primary linked themes were generated: (a) lack of person-centred care; (b) complexity of survival. At an organisational level, a fragmented health service and accessibility to the health system were barriers, and resulted in poor person-centred care. At a clinical level, attitude & treatment from healthcare providers together with health knowledge all combined to illustrate poor person-centred care as barriers to homeless women accessing antenatal/postnatal healthcare. Sub-themes associated with complexity of survival included: disillusion with life, distrust of services, competing lifestyle demands and support and relationships. The findings of this review highlight that poor engagement may be partly explained by the complex interplay between both the healthcare system (person-centred care) and the individual (complexity of survival). Future services should be delivered in a way that recognises homeless people's complex and diverse needs, and should be reconfigured in order to try to meet them, through decreasing fragmentation of health services and staff training.","1365-2524     McGeough, Christine     Walsh, Aisling     Clyne, Barbara     Orcid: 0000-0002-1186-9495     Journal Article     Systematic Review     England     Health Soc Care Community. 2020 Sep;28(5):1380-1393. doi: 10.1111/hsc.12972.

Egan, National Institute for Health, School for Public Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom","Background Strategies to reduce alcohol-related health and social harms may include restrictions on alcohol availability. 'Reducing the Strength' (RtS) is a local-level intervention whereby offlicence stores voluntarily stop selling inexpensive 'super-strength' (â‰¥6.5% alcohol by volume) beers and ciders. The intervention aims to reduce alcohol consumption, crime and disorder, notably amongst homeless and street drinkers. As part of a broader evaluation, we explored the mechanisms by which RtS may affect these populations in one urban English local authority. Methods We conducted one large focus group with alcohol treatment professionals (N = 11) and semi-structured interviews with professionals working in homeless hostels (N = 6), alcohol services (N = 2) and street outreach teams (N = 2). Service providers were recruited following introductions from a local authority hostel commissioning manager and a public health strategist. After undertaking interviews with hostel staff, interviews were conducted with residents (N = 9) at two hostels. Data were analysed thematically utilising NVivo 10 for data management. Results Professionals and drinkers generally concurred that street drinkers and homeless drinkers were distinct, but intersecting subgroups and many, but not all, consume super-strength products. Some questioned whether availability could be substantially reduced by a voluntary scheme in a small, densely-populated area. Many highlighted the often reciprocal relationships between drinkers and shopkeepers, which may impact shops' willingness to comply with the initiative. In the intervention area there was some evidence that super-strength drinkers might consume less alcohol by using their limited income to purchase (still available) weaker beer. However, other drinkers talked about finding shops that still sold the product within or, given the small scale of the intervention, outside the intervention area. They also described increasing begging, switching to drinks with even higher alcohol contents or using illegal substances. Many professionals and drinkers participants argued street drinking was already being tackled directly through enforcement-related initiatives. The majority of professionals believed that intervention effectiveness depends on clear linkages to services that address the complex underlying reasons for excessive alcohol consumption. Conclusion This study underscores the challenges faced when intervening in a complex social system. The feasibility of local initiatives to reduce alcohol-related harms is affected by the ability to identify the target population and the products they consume, intervention scale, compliance and linking of services. There may also be unintended, and potentially harmful, responses to the removal of specific products amongst a target population characterised by multiple risk behaviours.","L638529050     2022-07-27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/jech-2015-206256.140,alcohol;adult;alcohol consumption;beer;clinical article;conference abstract;feasibility study;female;halfway house;heavy drinking;human;male;manager;public health;qualitative research;resident;risk behavior;semi structured interview;Alcoholics;Drinking,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

In September 2018, the Irish Government reported almost 10,000 individuals accessing state-funded emergency accommodation. The number of people experiencing homelessness rose 16% since the previous year. Among those awaiting social housing are a new cohort, those individuals with intellectual disability who now seek their own accommodation in favour of that previously provided by intellectual disability service providers. Methods: This presentation explores the attitudes and knowledge of mainstream housing staff towards persons with intellectual disabilities. Standardised attitudes, knowledge and social distance scales, as well as staff burnout were administered via an anonymous online survey. Results: Findings reveal the complex interaction between staff's engagement with individuals with intellectual disabilities, and their level of burnout, on the attitudes they hold towards people with intellectual disabilities. Implications: As government policies move towards mainstreaming, consideration must be given to the impact of negative attitudes towards disability among staff working in these services. Where appropriate, services may require interventions to foster disability awareness to ameliorate any negative perceptions. Such interventions may be particularly relevant in cases, such as homelessness services, where staff burnout is common.","L628696723     2019-08-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Conference Abstract,Intellectual/developmental disability | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population (HCP)",10.1111/jir.12654,adult;awareness;burnout;conference abstract;controlled study;female;government;homelessness;housing;human;intellectual impairment;major clinical study;male;perception;social distance;Intellectual Disability;Homeless Persons,,,N,N,Full text screen

McLaughlin, San Francisco Department of Public Health, 25 Van Ness Ave. Suite 500, San Francisco, CA, United States","Background: The opioid-related overdose epidemic remains a persistent public health problem in the United States and has been accelerated by the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. Existing, evidence-based treatment options for opioid use disorder (OUD) are broadly underutilized, particularly by people experiencing homelessness (PEH). PEH are also more likely to misuse and overdose on opioids. To better understand current gaps and disparities in OUD treatment experienced by PEH and efforts to address them, we synthesized the literature reporting on the intersection of housing status and OUD treatment. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the literature from the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection. We included studies describing treatment-related outcomes specific to PEH and articles assessing OUD treatment interventions tailored to this population. Relevant findings were compiled via thematic analysis and narratively synthesized. Results: 60 articles met our inclusion criteria, including 43 descriptive and 17 intervention-focused studies. These studies demonstrated that PEH experience more barriers to OUD treatment than their housed counterparts and access inpatient and detoxification treatment more commonly than pharmacotherapy. However, the reviewed literature indicated that PEH have similar outcomes once engaged in pharmacotherapy. Efficacious interventions for PEH were low-barrier and targeted, with housing interventions also demonstrating benefit. Conclusions: PEH have diminished access to evidence-based OUD treatment, particularly medications, and require targeted approaches to improve engagement and retention. To mitigate the disproportionate opioid-related morbidity and mortality PEH experience, innovative, flexible, and interdisciplinary OUD treatment models are necessary, with housing support playing an important role.","L2012008192     2021-05-18     2021-11-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108717,"buprenorphine;methadone;naloxone;clinical effectiveness;descriptive research;drug dependence treatment;drug detoxification;drug fatality;health care access;health care disparity;homelessness;hospital patient;housing;human;intervention study;morbidity;multidisciplinary team;opiate addiction;patient engagement;personal experience;review;systematic review;thematic analysis;treatment outcome;Analgesics, Opioid",,,N,N,Full text screen

Our aim was to examine the characteristics of the ED frequent attenders (FAs) by age (under 65 and over 65 years). Methods: We examined the prevalence of FA attending the ED of an Urban Teaching Hospital in a cross-sectional study between 2009 and 2011. FA was defined as an individual who presented to the ED four or more times over a 12-month period. Randomly selected groups of FA and non-FA from two age groups (under 65 and over 65 years) were then examined to compare the characteristics between older FAs and non-FAs and older FAs and younger FAs. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals for 12-month mortality in FA compared with non-FA aged at least 65 years. Results: Overall, 137 150 ED attendances were recorded between 2009 and 2011. A total of 21.6% were aged at least 65 years, 4.4% of whom were FAs, accounting for 18.4% of attendances by patients older than 65 years. There was a bimodal age distribution of FA (meanÂ±SD; under 65 years 40Â±12.7; and over 65 years 76.9Â±7.4). Older FAs were five times more likely to present outside normal working hours and 5.5 times more likely to require admission. Cardiovascular emergencies were the most common complaint, in contrast with the younger FA group, where injury and psychosocial conditions dominated. The odds ratio for death at 12 months was 2.07 (95% confidence interval 0.93-4.63; P=0.07), adjusting for age and sex. Conclusion: One-in-five ED patients older than 65 years of age are FAs. Older FAs largely present with complex medical conditions. Enhanced access to expert gerontology assessment should be considered as part of effective intervention strategies for older ED users.

Despite recent research documenting associations between evictions and drug-related risks and harms, including overdose, the mechanisms through which these occur remain poorly understood. This study to examines how evictions shape the drug use practices of people who use drugs in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside â€“ a neighbourhood with an established drug scene â€“ as the illicit drug supply changed. Methods: Qualitative interviews and geo-spatial data collection were conducted with 56 recently evicted PWUD. Data were analyzed by interfacing qualitative and geo-spatial data, and interpreted focusing on how structural vulnerability shaped spatial practices and drug-related risks post-eviction. Results: Findings demonstrate how post-eviction spatial practices and routines produced risk and harm as participants navigated the uncertainties of housing vulnerability and drug supply changes. Post-eviction disruptions complicated participantsâ€™ ability to engage with trusted drug sellers. Changes to spatial patterns and access to private spaces rendered public drug use inevitable, though this was mitigated to some degree by harm reduction supports. Abrupt changes to drug use patterns occurred due to post-eviction disruptions and included instrumental uses of methamphetamine to increase alertness and navigate survival amidst severe hardship. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate how post-eviction changes to routines and spatial patterns are framed by structural vulnerability and can exacerbate drug-related harms, particularly in the context of a changing drug supply. There is an urgent need for structural interventions and harm reduction responses to mitigate harms associated with evictions.","L2011471607     2021-03-30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108666,fentanyl;methamphetamine;adult;aged;alertness;article;Canada;displacement (people);drug abuse;drug intoxication;drug marketing;drug related risk;drug traffic;female;harm reduction;homelessness;housing;human;male;named groups of persons;people who use drugs;priority journal;qualitative research;risk;survival;violence,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

They are also more likely to have less access to healthcare. These processes of access can be better understood using Levesqueâ€™s access framework which addresses both supply (service provision) and demand (user abilities).

Retrieved articles were screened and those eligible were selected for data extraction. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included. Results: Fifty-six papers out of 538 identified were selected and aliased. Six main themes were identified: staff education, flexibility of systems, service coordination, patient preparedness, complex health needs and holistic care.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study examining ED referrals to psychiatry in an inner-city and suburban centre. The authors collected data on gender, age, employment, housing, clinical presentation, time of assessment and admissions, over a 1-month period. RESULTS: The total number referred was 213: inner-city nâ€‰=â€‰109 and suburban nâ€‰=â€‰104. The inner-city saw a younger population; 47/109 (43%) were aged between 20 and 29Â years, compared with 28/104 (27%) of suburban presenters (P value 0.0134). A higher number of presenters were aged over 60 in the suburban centre nâ€‰=â€‰13/104 (12.5%) versus the inner-city centre 3/109 (2.8%) (P value 0.0084). In the inner-city, the proportion of homeless presenters was significantly higher at 30/109 (28%) versus 5/104 (4.8%) in the suburban setting (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). Presentations related to substances were highest, a total of 73 (34.3%) across both centres, with no significant difference in clinical presentations across the two centres. The majority were seen in the on-call period, 74/109 (67.9%) in the inner-city centre and 66/104 (63.5%) in the suburban centre. The psychiatric admission rate was significantly different between the two centres, with 33/109 (30.3%) patients admitted in the inner-city centre and 13/104 (12.5%) patients admitted in the suburban centre (P value 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of ED referrals to psychiatry constitute patients with unmet social and addiction needs, who are seen out of hours. This prompts consideration of expanding both ED and community services to comprise a more multidisciplinary-resourced, 24/7 care model.","1863-4362     McLoughlin, Caoimhe     McLoughlin, Aoibheann     Jain, Sudha     Abdalla, Ahad     Cooney, John     MacHale, Siobhan     Journal Article     Ireland     Ir J Med Sci. 2021 Nov;190(4):1523-1528. doi: 10.1007/s11845-020-02496-w.

Our data refer to 1325 individuals who were homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. We investigate dynamics in homelessness and substance use over the survey period. We find that the two are closely related: homeless individuals are more likely to be substance users and substance users are more likely to be homeless. These relationships, however, are predominantly driven by observed and unobserved individual characteristics which cause individuals to be both more likely to be homeless and to be substance users. Once we take these personal characteristics into account it seems that homelessness does not affect substance use, although we cannot rule out that alcohol use increases the probability that an individual becomes homeless. These overall relationships also hide some interesting heterogeneity by 'type' of homelessness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Merrigan, NCIMD, Dubllin, Ireland","Background: PKU is an inherited metabolic disorder affecting phe-nylalanine metabolism. The Irish incidence is 1:4500. Currently there are 500 patients under the care of National Centre for Inherited Metabolic Disorders (NCIMD) in Temple Street Children's University Hospital (TSCUH). Practice at present is to admit PKU patients with phenylalanine (Phe) levels that are consistently out of range despite intensive multidisciplinary team (MDT) input on an outpatient basis. The aim of this current study was to evaluate changes in PKU levels pre, during and post admissions and to examine of there was a sustained impact post discharge. Methods: Ward admission record books from 2003-2013 were used to identify patients admitted for stabilisation only. Demographic data and the reason for admission was supported by the patient's medical and dietetic notes. Patient's individual Phe level records were used to collect their Phe levels 6 months prior to admission, during admission and at respective time points 1-6months & 7-12 months post discharge. Results: Fifty six patients were admitted from Jan 2003-December 2013. Patients were all < 18 years of age. Greater than 70% (n=39) of the reasons for admission were due to multiple issues. Average admission time was 5 days. There was a significant decrease in median Phe levels from prior to the admission to during the admission. However, there was a significant increase in median Phe levels from during the admission (505 Î¼mol/L) to both the 1-6 months and 7-12 months' time points(618 and 651Î¼mol/L respectively). Discussion: The results highlight that while inpatient admissions can stabilise levels within the acute setting this is not sustained long term. The ward environment does not accurately replicate home circumstances. Moreover this study highlighted that admissions are more likely to be multifactorial which are less likely to be possible to resolve during an admission period.","L623867417     2018-09-18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Physical health condition - Metabolic | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1007/s10545-018-0233-9,phenylalanine;child;conference abstract;demography;female;homeless youth;hospital patient;human;major clinical study;male;metabolic disorder;multidisciplinary team;outpatient;retrospective study;university hospital;Phenylalanine,,,N,N,Full text screen

Methods: Children (<18 years) with MCADD were identified via the National Centre for Inherited Metabolic Disorders and the metabolic laboratory at Temple Street Children's University Hospital. Central Statistics Office population data was used to calculate epidemiological figures. Results: From January 1,1998, to August 30, 2016, 17 children were diagnosed with MCADD in Ireland. The average age at clinical presentation was 1.48 years (range: 0.005 to 2.86 years) with 2 patients diagnosed post mortem. The incidence of MCADD during this period was 1:71 650 with a mortality of 15.38% in the first clinical presentation- no child died post diagnosis. The common c.985A>G mutation accounted for 88% of alleles. The current prevalence of MCADD was calculated to be 1.23 per 100,000 children. Conclusion: The incidence of MCADD in Ireland is lower than global estimates (incidence of 1: 10 000-30 000 in most countries where newborn screening is in place). The potential for underascertainment and late diagnosis of cases exists in Ireland and is of concern for a treatable condition with a significant risk of morbidity and mortality when undiagnosed. These findings support a previously unpublished study where 1000 newborn bloodspot screening cards were screened for the common mutation and an incidence of 1 in 66 000 births was calculated using the Hardy Weinberg equation.","L623678596     2018-09-04 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1177/2326409817722292,medium chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase;child;clinical feature;conference abstract;controlled study;diagnosis;female;gene frequency;homeless youth;human;infant;Ireland;major clinical study;male;metabolic disorder;morbidity;mortality;mutation;newborn;newborn screening;preschool child;prevalence;statistics;university hospital;Acyl Coenzyme A,,,N,N,Full text screen

Methods: Drawing from topics discussed at the 2017 meeting of InWomen's in Montreal, Canada, this article reviews key progress in research on substance use among women, adolescents, and families to delineate priorities for the next generation of research. Results: The field has seen significant accomplishments in multiple domains, including the management of pregnant women with substance use and comorbid psychiatric disorders, caring for neonates in opioid withdrawal, greater inclusion of and treatment options for LGBTQ + communities, gendered instrumentation, and gender-focused HIV interventions for adolescent girls and women. Women who use alcohol and other drugs often experience other comorbid medical conditions (chronic Hepatitis C and HIV), contextual confounders (intimate partner violence exposure, homelessness, trauma), and social expectations (e.g., as caretakers) that must be addressed as part of integrated care to effectively treat women's substance use issues. Although significant advances have been made in the field to date, gender-based issues for women remain a neglected area in much of substance abuse research. Few dedicated and gender-focused funding opportunities exist and research has been siloed, limiting the potential for collaborations or interdisciplinary cross-talk. Conclusion: Given renewed attention to substance use in the context of the burgeoning opioid epidemic and shifts in global politics that affect women's substance use, the field requires a strategic rethink to invigorate a pipeline of future research and researchers.","L2001636912     2019-03-05     2019-03-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.01.017,adolescent health;Canada;chronic hepatitis C;comorbidity;drug dependence;family health;homelessness;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;implementation science;LGBT people;mental disease;newborn care;partner violence;pregnant woman;priority journal;review;withdrawal syndrome;women's health;Substance-Related Disorders,,,N,N,Full text screen

We undertook a systematic 'review of reviews' to investigate the effects of interventions for this population on substance use, housing, and related outcomes, as well as on treatment engagement, retention and successful completion. Methods and findings We searched ten electronic databases from inception to October 2020 for reviews and syntheses, conducted a grey literature search, and hand searched reference lists of included studies. We selected reviews that synthesised evidence on any type of treatment or intervention that reported substance use outcomes for people who reported being homeless. We appraised the quality of included reviews using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles. Our search identified 843 citations, and 25 reviews met the inclusion criteria. Regarding substance use outcomes, there was evidence that harm reduction approaches lead to decreases in drug-related risk behaviour and fatal overdoses, and reduce mortality, morbidity, and substance use. Case management interventions were significantly better than treatment as usual in reducing substance use among people who are homeless. The evidence indicates that Housing First does not lead to significant changes in substance use. Evidence regarding housing and other outcomes is mixed. Conclusions People who are homeless and use drugs experience many barriers to accessing healthcare and treatment. Evidence regarding interventions designed specifically for this population is limited, but harm reduction and case management approaches can lead to improvements in substance use outcomes, whilst some housing interventions improve housing outcomes and may provide more stability. More research is needed regarding optimal treatment length as well as qualitative insights from people experiencing or at risk of homelessness.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 1 Total Times Cited: 1 Cited Reference Count: 75 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1371/journal.pone.0254729,HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES;SUBSTANCE USE;HEALTH-SERVICES;MENTAL-ILLNESS;HOUSING 1ST;INTERVENTIONS;INDIVIDUALS;ADULTS;UK;EXPERIENCE,,,N,N,Full text screen

However, it remains unclear if the extent of immune dysregulation differs between methamphetamine users who engage in injection drug use (Meth IDU) and methamphetamine users who do not. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 86 sexual minority men living with HIV who had an undetectable viral load (< 40 copies/mL) and recent, biologically confirmed methamphetamine use. Meth IDU participants were compared to methamphetamine users who did not report IDU with respect to microbial translocation, immune activation, and inflammation plasma biomarkers. Multiple linear regression models were adjusted for age, antiretroviral therapy regimen, CD4 + T-cell count, and reactive urine toxicology results (Tox+) for stimulants. Results: The Meth IDU participants were significantly more likely to be homeless and Tox + for stimulants. In adjusted analyses, those reporting Meth IDU displayed elevated plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), soluble CD163 (sCD163), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and soluble tumor necrosis factor â€“ alpha receptor I (sTNF-Î±RI). Discussion: Even among methamphetamine users with treated HIV, those who engage in Meth IDU display exacerbations in key pathophysiologic processes that are linked to faster clinical HIV progression. These findings highlight the importance of screening for Meth IDU, discussing safer injection practices, and providing linkages to needle exchanges to reduce the harms of Meth IDU. Those who are not ready, willing, or able to abstain from methamphetamine use could also derive important health benefits from avoiding Meth IDU.","L2006797241     2020-07-06     2020-07-07 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108133,biological marker;CD14 antigen;CD163 antigen;interleukin 6;lipopolysaccharide binding protein;methamphetamine;tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor;adult;article;CD4+ T lymphocyte;cross-sectional study;drug use;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;injection drug user;lymphocyte count;major clinical study;male;pathogenesis;priority journal;protein blood level;sexual and gender minority;virus load;Biological Markers;Methamphetamine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This study is the first in Australia to examine strategic positioning and decision making among leading NFP housing providers (sometimes called third sector providers), from an organisational rather than housing policy perspective. Using a methodology that has been developed for similar studies of third sector organisations in other countries, the research provides an 'insider' perspective on how the organisations are responding to their opportunities and responsibilities as growing providers of a range of affordable housing options. The result of recent developments in this sector has been the first blush of a social enterprise model for the provision of affordable housing, combining the logic of business with a social mission to expand housing opportunities and choices for lower income households not being served by either the public sector or the private market. The research investigated how organisations develop a social enterprise model, reconciling social mission with commercial practice through what is sometimes called organisational hybridity (see Chapter 2). Research methods and coverage: The research used a modified Delphi survey methodology developed and applied to earlier studies of change and decision making in third sector housing organisations in England, Northern Ireland, Ireland and the Netherlands. Professor David Mullins (University of Birmingham), who first adapted the methodology to research organisational dynamics in this sector, has acted as a mentor for the study. The Delphi methodology is a way of exploring decision making and change through an iterative, multi-method approach. It seeks to harness the views of a panel of experts on specific issues, using a combination of scaled survey questions and qualitative interviews. In-depth discussions with each panel member are used to elicit perspectives on the aggregate results of the survey concerning the issues and challenges facing their sector as a whole, as well as to tease out their individual positioning on these matters. This is intended as a way of discerning not only shared but also divergent views within the sector. Sampling of housing NFPs for this study was restricted to those organisations in Australia that were exhibiting hybridity and social enterprise (see Chapter 2) and had been established for at least three years. These were organisations that had relatively large operations (in the Australian context) involving housing development and investment, and tenancy and property management. The chief executive officers (CEOs) of 14 organisations (of an estimated population of around 30 larger, diversified organisations) were approached and all agreed to participate, and comprised the panel of experts for the study. Collectively, the 14 organisations owned or managed over 22 000 dwellings, just under a half of those held in the total sector in 2010 (AIHW 2011). They owned assets (mainly dwellings) valued at $2.6 billion against which they held liabilities of $764 million (mostly loans secured against properties), and their combined annual rent revenue (their main income source) amounted to $132 million in 2010-11 (see Chapter 1, Tables 1 and 2). All had experienced rapid growth in their resources and business scale over the last three years, through a variety of strategies, which were explored in detail in the research. The research findings presented in Chapters 3 to 6 are based on an analysis of the survey of the sampled organisations, information gathered in interviews, including verbatim quotations from panel members, and other documentary evidence concerning the organisations studied and the policy and regulatory environment in which they operate. This analysis explored five key themes: 1. The key external environmental factors that have driven recent changes in organisations (Chapter 3). 2. The views of CEOs about key values of their organisations and how these have influenced their decision making (Chapter 3). 3. Changes in strategic positioning over the last three years (Chapter 4). 4. Changes in governance, structure, capacity and culture that have resulted from expansion and business development over the last three years (Chapter 5). 5. The most important strategic decisions that are facing organisations over the next five years and their potential significance (Chapter 6). Key findings under each of these themes are summarised below. Research findings: External drivers: Developments in housing policy, funding and regulatory environments have been the main drivers of recent opportunities for Australia's housing third sector to up-scale, commercialise and diversify. The most significant government-led changes that have driven expansion have included the Australian Government's Social Housing Initiative (SHI) and the joint Australian and state government National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS). Other recent housing policy changes and requirements of governments have included (to a varying extent across jurisdictions) new specialised regulatory arrangements applying to NFP housing providers, transfers of increasing numbers of former government owned and/or managed stock to this sector in return for leveraging the resources (cash flows and security) that come with such transfers, and a range of other policy changes that have been favourable to the sector, especially restructuring of social housing rents to capture Commonwealth Rent Assistance to improve rent revenue. Over the three years preceding the research (2008/09-2011/12), housing and finance market conditions had a mixed influence on the business operations of organisations in the sample. While land and construction costs remain high in Australia and conditions for lending into the sector had deteriorated since the global financial crisis (GFC), overall the post-GFC market environment and government stimulus had improved the competitiveness of these NFPs and had helped them to generate new relationships with private sector organisations, especially bank lenders and development partners. The last three years have also seen renewed interest at the national level in the future role, shape and efficiency of the wider third sector in Australia, particularly as a key contributor to the Australian government's agenda to promote social inclusion. Reforms broadly aimed at streamlining regulatory and taxation settings applying to the sector, improving governance and accountability, and channelling capital investment into the sector have been under consideration. While there are expectations that many positive changes may result, continuing uncertainty associated with the process of reform has made future planning in the sector more difficult and added to risk associated with taking on new business ventures. Organisational values: In discussions with panel members about the values underpinning their organisations, claims to social purpose emerged as a very strong internal driver of decision making and strategic positioning for all organisations. Organisations in the sample were founded to provide social housing and other welfare services to very low income households, the homeless and those with special needs, largely by utilising government funds. The study found interesting differences in the views of the panellists about how social mission is best achieved as organisations adopted more commercial practices. While some expressed a view that social purpose should never be compromised by business drivers, others appeared to have a greater appetite to innovate and take on business risks to advance social goals, emphasising that having a business ethos was critical to optimising social outcomes.Other values widely acknowledged as important attributes of modern third sector organisations were largely shared across panel members. These included having a professional approach, being entrepreneurial, being geographically diverse (to a varying extent among this sample), having the means to set one's own priorities and adopting a private sector ethos. Strategic positioning: Major shifts in strategic positioning over the last three years (Chapter 4) centre on organisations: â†’Broadening their service remit to include both low and moderate income households. â†’Acquiring and using property assets to develop their businesses. â†’Securing larger tranches of private finance for housing development. â†’Extending the geographic area of their operations across regions, state borders or nationally. Whilst these were general trends, there were clear differences in how organisations currently operated. For instance, there were differences in the extent to which they were prepared to enter into more commercial activities-such as mixed tenure developments, higher rental products, market sales, for-profit activities and asset realisation-to seek out financial return and drive their business expansion. At one end of the spectrum, some organisations had already leveraged assets to a considerable extent and had trialled cross-subsidy approaches, mixed tenure projects and partnering with the private sector with the overall aim of generating more housing for low income groups as well as providing services to current residents. In the foreseeable future they were planning to pursue a wide range of activities for both low and moderate income households, subject to financial feasibility. Others were more cautious about, or constrained in pursuing, additional activities and expansion, such as higher-cost rental products and operating in additional locations.

This study explores Gypsy/Traveller and homeless service users' perceptions of the impact of an anticipatory care health intervention ('Keep Well'), in which nurses and outreach workers provided a health check and support to address risk factors, particularly in relation to CVD. Service users were referred to the outreach workers for educational and motivational support, signposting/referral (to courses or services), or practical help (e. g. accompanying to appointments). Methods Gypsy/Traveller (n = 375) and homeless (n = 102) service users who accessed the service between 1 January 2010 and 20 June 2011 were compared using descriptive statistics of demographical and clinical data. Participants were recruited through Keep Well nurses and outreach workers. In-depth interviews were conducted with eight homeless and five Gypsy/Traveller service users, who were purposively sampled to generate maximally diverse samples in relation to age, sex and type of involvement in the project (e.g. number of contacts with nurse, whether they received support from the outreach workers). Interviews were transcribed and analysed using a Grounded Theory approach. Results Both Gypsy/Traveller and homeless service user groups were found to have substantial rates of ill-health, poor wellbeing and unhealthy behaviours. The groups differed on current smoking rates and average body mass indices but had similarly high levels of CVD risk (ASSIGN scores). Both groups felt a positive impact from the intervention but with emphasis on slightly differing elements. Gypsy/Travellers greatly valued the educative aspects of the service and receipt of diagnostic information, while homeless people benefitted from the support and the psychological boost they received from contact with the nurses and outreach workers. The relaxed, friendly, culturally sensitive and personal nature of Keep Well was instrumental in the successful engagement of these frequently unhealthy and challenging service users. Conclusion Based on the findings, we identify a need for specialist outreach services for these groups; highlight the value of practitioners' cultural sensitivity and time spent building relationships; and recommend further research into the health profiles of, and effective interventions for, these groups.","L638528941     2022-07-27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/jech-2015-206256.166,adult;body mass;cardiovascular risk;conference abstract;controlled study;cultural sensitivity;female;genetic transcription;grounded theory;homeless person;human;interview;major clinical study;male;nurse;patient referral;perception;physician;risk factor;Romani (people);smoking;travel;wellbeing;worker,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Research is needed to understand the contributions of COVID-19 and subsequent infection control measures. We sought to estimate the prevalence of and factors associated with nonfatal overdose among participants in nine prospective cohorts of people who use unregulated drugs (PWUD) in Canada and the US. Methods: Data were derived from nine cohorts of PWUD in urban centres in Canada (Vancouver, BC) and the US (Baltimore, MD; Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; Los Angeles, CA) between May, 2020 and April, 2021. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with nonfatal overdose among participants who used unregulated drugs in the past month. Results: Among 885 participants (including 253 females), 41 (4.6 %) experienced a non-fatal overdose in the past month, and 453 (51.2 %) reported being highly impacted day-to-day by the pandemic. In multivariable analyses, people who experienced a non-fatal overdose were more likely to be female (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=2.18;95 % Confidence Interval [CI]=1.10â€“4.30); unstably housed/homeless (AOR=2.16;95 % CI=1.11â€“4.26); engaged in medications for opioid use disorder (AOR=2.45;95 % CI=1.19â€“4.97); and highly impacted day-to-day (AOR=2.42;95 % CI=1.22â€“5.10). Conclusion: Our findings may reflect characteristics of participants who experienced a compounding of vulnerabilities during the pandemic and thus are vulnerable to overdose, including women, those unstably housed/homeless, and those who perceived their daily lives were highly impacted by the pandemic. Multi-level interventions are needed to remediate the vulnerabilities and address the main driver of poisoning crisis.","L2020398673     2022-10-03 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109633,addiction;adult;article;California;Canada;city;cohort analysis;controlled study;coronavirus disease 2019;drug overdose;female;harm reduction;human;Illinois;intoxication;major clinical study;male;Maryland;pandemic;prevalence;prospective study;public health;United States;opiate,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This is partially due to the lack of clarity about whether marijuana use impacts one's ability to achieve abstinence from the target of addiction treatment. We examined the association between marijuana use and abstinence from other substances among individuals with substance dependence. Methods: A secondary analysis of the Addiction Health Evaluation And Disease management study, a randomized trial testing the effectiveness of chronic disease management. Individuals met criteria for drug or alcohol dependence and reported recent drug (i.e. opioid or stimulant) or heavy alcohol use. Recruitment occurred largely at an inpatient detoxification unit, and all participants were referred to primary medical care. The association between marijuana use and later abstinence from drug and heavy alcohol use was assessed using longitudinal multivariable models. Results: Of 563 study participants, 98% completed at least one follow-up assessment and 535 (95%) had at least one pair of consecutive assessments and were included. In adjusted analyses, marijuana use was associated with a 27% reduction in the odds of abstinence from drug and heavy alcohol use (adjusted odds ratio 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.97], P= 0.03). Conclusions: Marijuana use among individuals with alcohol or other drug dependence is associated with a lower odds of achieving abstinence from drug and heavy alcohol use. These findings add evidence that suggests concomitant marijuana use among patients with addiction to other drugs merits attention from clinicians.

Current Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA)- Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) surveillance definitions (2010) were considered in light of our NGS findings. The initial transmission was not detectable using current criteria, because of 16 weeks between ST-295 exposure and symptoms. We included 3 patients with hostel exposure who met surveillance criteria of hospital-acquired infection due to their hospital admissions. CONCLUSION NGS analysis enhanced epidemiological information and helped identify and resolve an outbreak beyond the capacity of standard PCR ribotyping. In this cluster of cases, NGS was used to identify a hostel as the likely source of community-based C. difficile transmission.

Thereafter, the disorder's links with interpersonal trauma have been established. OBJECTIVE: Within a sample of homeless adults in Ireland, the (1) prevalence of ICD-11 disorders specifically associated with stress; Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and CPTSD, (2) nature of interpersonal trauma exposure, self-identified index events, and their association with the diagnostic criteria of CPTSD, and (3) relationship between cumulative interpersonal trauma exposure and CPTSD via self-compassion were examined. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Adults using homeless services (NÂ =Â 56) completed self-report measures of socio-demographics, trauma-history, PSTD, CPTSD, and self-compassion. METHODS: The data were analysed using chi-squared and mediation analyses (via PROCESS). RESULTS: CPTSD was highly prevalent (33.9%) among the sample, but PTSD was not (3.6%). Emotional neglect was the most prevalent interpersonal trauma and the most common index event. Only lifetime sexual abuse (from someone other than a parent or guardian) was associated with CPTSD diagnostic status (Ï‡(2)Â =Â 3.94, (1), pÂ =Â .047). When adjusted for gender, relationship status, and living situation, self-compassion mediated the relationship between cumulative interpersonal trauma exposure and CPTSD severity (BÂ =Â 1.30, SEÂ =Â 0.50, 95% CIÂ =Â [0.43-2.35]). CONCLUSION: Findings support the relevance of CPTSD to understanding psychopathology in homeless adults and the potential role of self-compassion in interventions. Further, they open debate on the nature of events that are considered traumatic - subjectively and in psychiatric canon.","1873-7757     McQuillan, Katie     Hyland, Philip     ValliÃ¨res, FrÃ©dÃ©rique     Journal Article     England     Child Abuse Negl. 2022 May;127:105569. doi: 10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105569.

Monteiro, Department of Health Law, Policy, and Management, Boston University School of Public Health, United States","Background and Aims: Persons who inject drugs (PWID) experience high rates of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and often access emergency or inpatient treatment. However, many PWID do not seek care and self-treat some or all of their infections. The goal of the current study was to examine predictors of self-treatment of SSTI in a sample of hospitalized PWID, and describe methods of and reasons for self-treatment. Methods: PWID (N = 252) were recruited from inpatient medical units at an urban safety-net hospital to join a behavioral intervention trial. The baseline interview focused on past-year SSTI incidence and related treatment, including reasons for not accessing medical care and methods of self-treatment. Results: Of study participants, 162 (64%) reported having at least one SSTI in the past year. This subset was 59.9% White/Caucasian with a mean age of 38.0 (SD + 10.5). One-third of these participants (32.3%) reported ever self-treating SSTI in the past year. In a logistic regression model, number of past-year infections (OR = 1.81, p < .001) and positive outlook (OR = 2.46, p < .001) were associated with self-treatment of SSTI. Common methods of self-treatment included mechanically draining sores, applying heat/warm compress, and cleaning affected areas. Continued drug use and belief that infections were not serious and could be self-treated were two main reasons for not seeking professional medical care. Conclusions: Interventions targeting SSTI among PWID should include education on when to seek medical care and the risks of serious infection, and could be implemented at local clinics or harm reduction programs to increase access.","L2003999292     2019-11-29     2019-12-05 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107695,compress;heat compress;warm compress;cocaine;diamorphine;adult;article;Black person;Caucasian;cohort analysis;controlled study;disease severity;female;health belief;health care access;health program;homelessness;hospital patient;human;incidence;infection risk;injection drug user;major clinical study;male;medical care;outcome assessment;patient education;prediction;priority journal;race difference;risk reduction;safety net hospital;self care;skin infection;soft tissue infection;urban area;wound care;wound drainage,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Access to both mental health and primary care services may be more difficult for these patients and it has been shown that homeless mental health service users have low rates of GP attendance. Aims and methods: We aimed to look at General Practitioner (GP) involvement in the care of patients referred to a Dublin city mental health service for homeless people. The initial audit cycle looked at referrals from August 2004 to February 2005. The second cycle looked at referrals from August 2007 to January 2009. Notes were retrospectively reviewed looking in particular at these issues: [1.] Contact information about the patient''s GP on the referral form [2.] GP contact following initial assessment Results: The contact our service made with GPs following the first cycle of this audit improved from 50% to 63%. Letters to GPs were sent in 48% of cases which shows an improvement from 36% but still falls short of the agreed standard of letters to all GPs. The breakdown of the figures for cases that did not have a letter sent to their GP highlights the difficulties involved in follow up of this patient group. Discussion: Close collaboration between mental health services for homeless people and general practitioners is vital in the management of this vulnerable patient group whose needs are complex. Audit is a continuous cycle and further, more frequent reviews of this subject are required to maintain and improve on these results.

Morales, 3440 Keswick Road, Baltimore, MD, United States","Background: Death from fentanyl-related overdose is now a leading cause of mortality among US adults. We sought to characterize fentanyl preference among street-based people who use drugs (PWUD). Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were administered to PWUD (N = 308) who illicitly used heroin or prescription opioids in the prior six months. Recruitment occurred in 2017 in three US east coast cities with high overdose mortality: Baltimore, Boston, and Providence. Our main outcome was preference for fentanyl (yes/no); exposures included sociodemographics, drug use, and overdose history. Pearson's Ï‡2, Shapiro-Wilk-Mann rank-sum tests, and tiered log-binomial regression determined sociodemographic and exposure-related factors associated with fentanyl preference. Results: Preference for nonmedical use of fentanyl was reported by 27% (n = 83) of the sample. Fentanyl preference was associated with non-Hispanic white race (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) = 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.18â€“2.40), daily illicit drug use (aRR = 2.2, CI:1.71â€“2.87), and overdose â‰¥1 year ago (aRR = 1.33, CI:1.18â€“1.50). Age (in decades; aRR = 0.77, CI:0.61â€“0.98) and overdose <1 year ago (aRR = 0.92, CI:0.87â€“0.97) were associated with a decreased likelihood of preference. In our model excluding sociodemographics, initiating opioid use with non-prescribed opioids was associated with fentanyl preference (aRR = 1.48, CI:1.26-1.73). Conclusion: In three cities with high levels of opioid use and overdose, a quarter of street based PWUD reported preferring fentanyl. An opioid use age cohort effect and disproportionate access to prescription opioids by race could be contributing to preference. Frequency of opioid use, not route of administration, was associated with preference. Our data demonstrate the need to consider preferences for fentanyl when targeting services and interventions for PWUD.","L2002901589     2019-09-20     2019-09-24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107547,benzodiazepine derivative;cocaine;diamorphine;fentanyl;tranquilizer;adult;age;article;controlled study;cross-sectional study;drug abuse;drug preference;exposure;female;frequency;homelessness;human;income;injection drug user;male;medical history;mortality;priority journal;correctional facility;race difference;risk;smoking;snorting;social problem;United States;Cross-Sectional Studies;Drug Packaging;Cesarean Section;Fentanyl,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

It then discuss projects with people with dementia, focusing on two main approaches to designing with this population-one that pays particular attention to the deficits inherent to the disease, and one that prioritizes the abilities that are still present in participants. The chapter also discusses the challenges of living as a homeless person, and takes a look at the appropriation of technologies that this population uses to maintain its own wellbeing, as well as a series of studies that detail the complexities inherent in carrying out a research process with a group of people whose circumstances change daily. The chapter discusses this creative use of available information and communication technologies (ICT), even if it is not state of the art ICT, as a feature of these participants' resilience. The final set of studies that we will visit briefly in this chapter formed part of Rachel Clarke's research at Newcastle University.

To see how official policies are realised in everyday practice, sixteen interviews have been conducted in Copenhagen and Dublin with various representatives of organisations that support homeless EU migrants. A typology of strategies and practices used by the staff for dealing with those situations emerged from the interviews. An analysis has been conducted to trace the interpretive frames that enable social workers to make sense of their actions and express their values. In Copenhagen, the dominant â€˜migrant workerâ€™ frame embraces official policy, and shifts the responsibility on the migrant, but is often supplemented by the â€˜exceptional humanitarianismâ€™ frame that allows staff to express their professional values. In Dublin, a large programme devised especially for migrants but focused on efficiency, makes the â€˜undisciplined deviantâ€™ frame the most common, while leaving many of the staff frustrated. These findings pose interesting questions regarding whether new policies and services for migrants should not only be more inclusive and personalised, but also take social workers' responses into consideration.","research.

The focus of the study is the policy field of housing-related support services, known in the UK as 'Supporting People'. This is a hybrid policy field involving several government departments, a number of market mechanisms and two types of third-sector actors. The exercise of organisational agency to adapt to competing drivers is illuminated through mental health and homelessness case studies. The paper explores how competing external influences from the Northern Ireland Assembly, horizontal policies for the third-sector and vertical service commissioning policies interact with TSOs' own adaptation strategies involving the deployment of robust third-sector identities. Hybridisation is found to involve not only the dominance of state drivers and the promotion of market mechanisms in both fields, but also enactment of third-sector identities. Our analysis of hybridization in this case counters Billis' (2010) representation of third-sector identity as weak, in flux, and subject to erosion by focusing on the agency of TSOs to strategically adapt to and negotiate external drivers and thereby achieve competitive advantage. Through the enactment of identity in this adaptation process, resources such as legitimacy, charitable income and volunteers are secured. This provides opportunities for policy makers to add value if they are prepared to emphasise horizontal over vertical policy goals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 6 Total Times Cited: 6 Cited Reference Count: 44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s11266-013-9423-0,Hybridity;Supporting people;Mental health;Homelessness;Housing associations;Northern Ireland;VOLUNTARY SECTOR;Ireland,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published from 2001 to 2019. We included qualitative studies involving US participants that focused on access experiences, views, or accounts of unintended pregnancy and/or abortion among youth experiencing homelessness. We excluded studies published before 2001 as that was the year mifepristone medication abortion was made available in the US and we aimed to investigate experiences of access to both medical and surgical abortion options. RESULTS: Our thematic analysis of the data resulted in five key themes that characterize the abortion attitudes and access experiences of youth experiencing homelessness: (1) engaging in survival sex and forced sex, (2) balancing relationships and autonomy, (3) availability does not equal access, (4) attempting self-induced abortions using harmful methods, and (5) feeling resilient despite traumatic unplanned pregnancy experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Youth experiencing homelessness experience barriers to abortion access across the US, including in states with a supportive policy context and publicly funded abortion services. In the absence of accessible services, youth may consider harmful methods of self-induced abortion. Improved services should be designed to offer low-barrier abortion care with the qualities that youth identified as important to them, including privacy and autonomy.","1932-6203     Munro, Sarah     Orcid: 0000-0002-3884-6592     Benipal, Savvy     Williams, Aleyah     Wahl, Kate     Trenaman, Logan     Begun, Stephanie     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Systematic Review     United States     PLoS One. 2021 Jul 1;16(7):e0252434. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0252434. eCollection 2021. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0252434,"Abortion, Induced/*psychology;*Attitude;Female;Homeless Persons/*psychology;Humans;Personal Autonomy;Pregnancy;Resilience, Psychological;Sexual Behavior;Adolescent;United States",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

The Irish case echoes historical experiences elsewhere and is offered not as an exceptional or extreme case but as an inâ€depth single case study and a lens for comparison. Although contemporary forms and combinations of conditionalities are new to Ireland, the experience of multiple conditionalities in benefits and housing is not new. Hence, a historical perspective is used to examine contemporary multiple conditionalities in benefits and housing. In the past, conditional regimes for lone parents were justified in terms of moral reformation for first time mothers and avoiding moral contagion of mothers with subsequent pregnancies. In contemporary times, in the case of employment, lone parents are problematised as working partâ€time and ""nesting"" on inâ€workâ€benefits, and in the case of homelessness, lone parents who prioritise the security of tenure embedded in social housing are accused of ""gaming"" the system. While acknowledging ambiguities, the paper finds the overlap of welfare and housing discourses contribute, intentionally or unintentionally, to epistemological foundations or understandings of lone parents, shifting public perceptions, and framing them as ""problems"" to be solved. They simultaneously temper lone parents' expectations. Increased precarity and disempowerment is associated with dual conditionality, and ontological uncertainty is multiplied when experienced cumulatively across employment, social protection, and housing regimes in a context of generally poor public services and labour market precarity and in the historical context of stigmatisation.

Living in homeless accommodation during the early years of a child's life also has the potential to impact on a child in many ways, for example, academically, physically, emotionally and socially. In the current paper, the authors review existing literature regarding the impact of family homelessness on children's development in order to identify key messages for social work practitioners working with children and families experiencing homelessness, for example, in the field of child protection and welfare. Findings reveal that family homelessness impacts on various aspects of a child's world and ultimately on their development, as a result of reduced social networks, inappropriate space to facilitate play, increased school mobility and schoolâ€dropout rates and increased levels of behavioural challenges and mental health concerns. These findings are discussed with relevance to social work practice when working with children and families who experience homelessness and how social work professionals can address the developmental needs of children who experience homelessness. Implications regarding future research and the education and training of social workers are also explored.

Several studies have shown that people who are homeless experience more significant suicidal ideation and behavior than the general population. However, there is limited information about what suicide interventions exist, to what extent they are grounded in robust research, and which intervention components effectively reduce suicidal ideation and behavior in the homeless community. This research aimed to characterise the current evidence base in the area of suicide prevention for homeless individuals. METHODS: A scoping review guided by Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework was conducted and a narrative synthesis was performed. Pubmed, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Open Grey, and Bielefeld Academic Search Engine were searched up to 8 May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 3209 records were identified through database and grey literature searching. Three studies are included in this review.

Shame is relevant to issues of the self, other-generated conceptualizations of the self, and rule-governed behavior. Contextual behavioral science outlines a philosophically sound, theoretically coherent, evidence-based account of the self that lends itself to empirical work. More specifically, recent developments in relational frame theory have resulted in a behavioral measure of both self and other discriminations and types of rule-governed behavior evident in naturally occurring language, namely the Functional Self-Discrimination Measure (FSDM). Using the FSDM with a sample of adults experiencing homelessness (n = 22), the present study examined the relationships between occurrences of self and other discriminations and shame, well-being, and psychological inflexibility. The present study also explored whether occurrences of self, other, and rules codes were related. Findings indicated that both shame and psychological inflexibility were associated with greater unfavorable self-evaluations and greater references to rule-governed behavior and the self as distinct from private events. Wellbeing was associated with greater favorable self-evaluations and greater references to values-oriented self-rules and beliefs. Findings are discussed with reference to a need to further refine existing FSDM codes, examine FSDM data at more than one time-point, and explore other aspects of relational responding in addition to the frequency of occurrence in natural-language speech.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 1 Total Times Cited: 1 Cited Reference Count: 70 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: SDOH - shame | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong topic",10.1016/j.jcbs.2021.06.003,Self;Rule-governed behavior;Homelessness;Shame;Well-being;Psychological flexibility;Functional self-discrimination measure;DISCRIMINATION RESPONSE FUNCTIONS;MENTAL-HEALTH;QUALITATIVE RESEARCH;AS-CONTEXT;EMOTION REGULATION;PEOPLE SAY;STIGMA;ACCEPTANCE;IDENTITY;GUILT,,,N,N,Full text screen

However, existing research on patterns and risk factors for drug use and how they vary by age and location in Turkey is limited. Methods: We examined the socio-demographic characteristics, drug use behaviors, and treatment history of citizens admitted to inpatient substance use treatment at public and private facilities in Turkey during 2012 and 2013 and identified correlates of lifetime and current injection drug use. Results: Of the 11,247 patients at the 22 public treatment centers in 2012-2013, a majority were male, lived with family, were unemployed, and had an average age of 27 years. Within private clinics (n = 663), a higher proportion was female (9.7% private vs. 5.7% public), aged 11-17 years old (13% vs. 7.4%), used cannabis as their primary drug (18.4% vs. 13.2%), and had previously received drug treatment (57% vs. 47.2%). Within public centers, 40.4% reported ever injecting drugs and 33.7% reported injecting in the past 30 days; the corresponding percentages at private clinics were 22.5% and 18.1%. Significant predictors of injection drug use included being homeless, being a temporal employee or unemployed, having higher education, heroin as a preferred drug, having a longer duration of drug use, and prior drug treatment. Conclusion: Prevention and intervention efforts are needed to reduce the transition to heroin and injection drug use among youth as well as improve access to a variety of drug treatment options for people who use substances in Turkey.

We analyzed factors associated with substance use treatment completion. We focused on factors that can be influenced by health care system changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Data and methods: We used the 2010 Treatment Episode Data Set Discharges (TEDS-D), which is made available by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). We analyzed factors associated with substance use treatment completion using logistic regression. Results: Individuals in residential treatment were often unemployed or not in the labor force, had prior substance use treatment episodes, used more than one substance, and were uninsured. Factors associated with treatment completion included older age, greater education, employment, criminal justice referral, not being homeless, and private insurance. Conclusion: The expansion in private insurance coverage as a result of the ACA may result in more treatment completion in residential settings. Changes to the Medicaid program resulting from the ACA, including coverage of substance use treatment as an essential health benefit and greater support for housing, education, and employment, may also contribute to more residential discharges ending in treatment completion.

Methods: The study employed a semi-structured interview format utilising a specifically designed questionnaire which received ethical approval from the Limerick University Hospitals Group ethics committee. Results: Fifty psychiatric inpatients were interviewed. Fifteen were either â€œcurrentlyâ€ homeless (nÂ =Â 8) or had experienced â€œpastâ€ homelessness (nÂ =Â 7). Those who had experienced homelessness were more likely to have a psychotic illness. A majority of those who had experienced homelessness believed that psychiatric illness contributed to their homelessness. Involuntary admission rates were more than double for patients in the homeless group. A number of participants also reported that a lack of accommodation was preventing their discharge. Conclusion: Homelessness affects a significant number of psychiatric patients and can be both a contributory factor to, and consequence of, mental illness. With homelessness at unprecedented levels, there is a need for the development of tailored programmes aimed at supporting these vulnerable groups.

METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of homeless children attending a paediatric emergency department in Dublin, Ireland, from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2020. Comparison was made with a random cohort of 1500 non-homeless paediatric attendances in 2019. Homelessness was defined using the European Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion, including those with addresses of no fixed abode, government homeless accommodation and certain residential settings. The objectives were to compare presentations between homeless and non-homeless children. We were interested in determining differences regarding demographics, healthcare utilisation, clinical presentation and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 197â€‰437 attendances 3138 (1.59%) were homeless. Compared with the non homeless, homeless children were less likely to be ethnically Irish (37.4% vs 74.6%, p<0.001) or have been born in Ireland (82.3% vs 96.2%, p<0.001). Irish Travellers (3% vs 0.8%), Roma (22.5% vs 2.4%) and black (21.1% vs 4.2%) ethnicities were over-represented (p<0.001) in the homeless cohort.Homeless children were younger (age <12 months: 26% vs 16%; p<0.001), less likely to be fully vaccinated (73.6% vs 81.9%, p<0.001) and have registered general practitioners (89.7% vs 95.8%, p<0.001). They were more likely to represent within 2â€‰weeks (15.9% vs 10.5%, p<0.001), and use ambulance transportation (13.2% vs 6.7%, p<0.001). Homeless children had lower acuity presentations (triage category 4-5: 47.2% vs 40.7%, p<0.001) and fewer admissions (5.9% vs 8.4%, p<0.001) than non-homeless children. DISCUSSION: Infants, Irish Travellers, Roma and black ethnicities were over-represented in homeless presentations. Homeless children had increased reliance on emergency services for primary healthcare needs.","2399-9772     O' Brien, Niamh     Orcid: 0000-0002-5034-1757     Quinn, Nuala     Joyce, Birgitta     Bedford, Helen     Orcid: 0000-0003-0908-1380     Crushell, Ellen     Journal Article     England     BMJ Paediatr Open. 2022 Mar;6(1):e001368. doi: 10.1136/bmjpo-2021-001368. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Use (ED)",10.1136/bmjpo-2021-001368,"Child;Emergency Service, Hospital;*Homeless Persons;*Homeless Youth;Humans;Infant;Ireland/epidemiology;Retrospective Studies;epidemiology;Only Child;Emergencies;Ireland",,,Y,Y,Included

Methods: Unique identifiers from 678 PWID in the Melbourne Injecting Drug User Cohort Study (MIX) were deterministically linked to state-level routine ED data collection records. We examined trends in annual ED presentations using Poisson regression. We defined annual frequent use as three or more presentations per year and analysed correlates of frequent presentation using logistic regression. Results: Over a third (36%) of the cohort presented to the ED at least once over the study period at a rate of 24.3 presentations per 100 person-years (95%confidence interval (CI) = 23.0-26.3). This represented 918 presentations among 244 PWID. The mean annual increase in ED presentations was 24%, although the increase was not statistically significant across the follow-up period. The most common diagnoses were mental and behavioural disorders (17%) and poisoning and other externalities (13%). A quarter (26%) of PWID who presented were classified as a frequent ED user in at least one calendar year, contributing to over half (56.9%) of all presentations. Frequent presentation was correlated with self-referral to ED (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.4, 95% (CI) = 1.4-4.0), non-injury related presentations (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.8), homelessness (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3-2.8), younger age: 15-24 compared to â‰¥30 years (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3), 25-29 compared to â‰¥30 years (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.3), and season: spring compared to autumn (AOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2-2.7).

However, the extent to which underlying mental health issues may contribute to substance use as a way to manage symptoms and whether mental health treatment may reduce risk for substance use is unclear. This paper investigated these relations in a community sample of homeless youth. Methods Youth ages 13â€“24 (NÂ =Â 416) were interviewed as part of a community count and survey of homeless youth in Houston, Texas. A path analysis examined relations among lifetime diagnoses of ADHD, bipolar disorder, and depression; past-month marijuana, alcohol, and synthetic marijuana use, and hypothesized mediators of past-year mental health treatment and perceived unmet need for treatment. Results Rates of prior mental disorder diagnoses were high, with extensive comorbidity across the three diagnoses (nÂ =Â 114, 27.3% had all three diagnoses). Relations varied by diagnoses and substances. ADHD was positively related to current marijuana use (Î²Â =Â 0.55 (0.16), pÂ <Â 0.001), a relation that mental health treatment did not mediate. Depression was positively related to synthetic marijuana use through unmet need (Î²Â =Â 0.25 (0.09), pÂ =Â 0.004) and to alcohol use through unmet need (Î²Â =Â 0.20 (0.10), pÂ =Â 0.04) Conclusions This study provides new information about relations between prior mental health diagnoses and substance use in homeless youth.

Despite the desire to quit, this group rarely receives the external support to make or maintain a successful quit attempt (SQA; intentional quit attempt lasting >24 h). The Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI) is a cigarette dependence measure that independently predicts SQAs among domiciled adults. For homeless adults, social support may be a way to buffer the impact of cigarette dependence on SQAs. Methods: The association of the HSI and past-year SQAs, and the potential moderating role of social support, was examined among 445 homeless smokers (Mage = 43.2 + 11.8, 65% male, 57.5% white). Support was measured by the International Support Evaluation List (ISEL-12) and its 3 subscales: tangible, belonging, & appraisal support. Results: The HSI was negatively correlated with SQAs (r=âˆ’.283, p <.01) and in a regression model controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, appraisal support significantly moderated this relationship (p <.05). The HSI was significantly related to SQAs across low, moderate, and high levels of appraisal support [mean, +1 SD; low (Î²=âˆ’.657, p <.001), medium (Î²=âˆ’.457, p <.001), and high (Î²=âˆ’.258, p <.05)]. Neither the ISEL-12 total nor the other subscales were moderators. Conclusion: The perceived availability of someone to talk to about one's problems appeared to attenuate the strength of the inverse relationship between the heaviness of smoking and SQAs. Fostering appraisal support for homeless smokers through group treatment may reduce the impact of cigarette dependence on making quit attempts. Social support coupled with the increased availability of empirically-supported cessation aids may improve dismal quit rates among homeless adults.","L2000949711     2018-07-18     2019-05-14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.06.007,adult;age;article;behavior disorder assessment;controlled study;correlation analysis;ethnicity;female;gender;Heaviness of Smoking Index;homeless person;human;International Support Evaluation List;major clinical study;male;middle aged;Oklahoma;patient attitude;priority journal;race;rating scale;smoking;smoking cessation;social support;Smoke;Social Support;Smoking,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Concurrent nicotine and tobacco product use have been shown to result in greater health problems than cigarette smoking alone, and little is known about the rates, motives, and perceived impacts of concurrent use in this group. The purpose of this study is to explore concurrent use rates and constructs of interest among homeless adult daily smokers and to examine differences between concurrent users and non-concurrent users on cigarette dependence, perceived risk of smoking, readiness to quit, and the receipt of recent cessation intervention. Methods: Participants (N = 396) were recruited from six homeless-serving agencies and/or shelters in Oklahoma City. Enrolled participants completed self-report questionnaires. Results: The rate of concurrent use was high âˆ’67.2%. Participants most frequently endorsed lower cost and a desire to cut down on cigarette smoking as motives for concurrent product use. Concurrent users indicated both a greater likelihood of developing a smoking-related disease if they did not quit for good and a greater number of past year quit attempts relative to non-concurrent users. There was no significant difference between concurrent users and non-concurrent users on readiness to quit or having received recent smoking cessation intervention. Conclusion: The need for cessation efforts that account for concurrent use for homeless adult smokers is great. Study findings indicate that concurrent users are commonly pursuing the reduction or elimination of cigarette usage and should be specifically targeted for cessation intervention.","L2000595217     2018-03-30     2019-05-14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.12.012,adult;article;bidi smoking;chewing tobacco;cigar smoking;cigarette smoking;controlled study;female;homelessness;hookah;human;male;Oklahoma;priority journal;self report;smoking cessation;smoking cessation program;snus;tobacco dependence;tobacco snuff;tobacco use;vaping;waterpipe tobacco;Niacin;Nicotine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Neto, School of Medicine, Federal University of Cariri, UFCA, Barbalha, CearÃ¡, Brazil","Background: Homeless experts and some federal housing officials are sounding the alarm that the patchwork of government efforts to address the coronavirus outbreak risks leaving out one group of acutely vulnerable people: the homeless. In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets. In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go? Method: The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation Results: With more cities suspecting community transmission of the novel coronavirus, people who sleep in shelters or hunker down outside already have a lower life expectancy and often have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk if they develop COVID-19 (Global News, 2020). These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition, and â€œextreme stress levels just to meet their daily needsâ€, all of which weakens the immune system. Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are â€œincredibly vulnerable to this virusâ€. Conclusions: Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently. For low-income patients, the various borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations regarding the basic needs. This is a serious concern when linked to the pandemic.","L2005567046     2020-04-22 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112939,coronavirus disease 2019;Coronavirus infection;disease transmission;health care need;health status;high risk population;homeless person;homelessness;human;immune system;letter;life expectancy;malnutrition;mental disease;mental stress;priority journal;SARS-related coronavirus;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;sleep debt;social psychiatry;substance abuse,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

He is asmoker with a background of heroin addiction and alcohol abuse. Hewas homeless and no family history available as he was fostered. Hischest radiography was unremarkable but he had inflammatorymarkers. He was treated for as chest infection and heroin withdrawal.CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrated multiple osteolytic lesions in thepelvis, sternum, thoracic and lumbar spine. His HIV, Quantiferon andblood cultures were negative. His immunoglobulins, urine Bence Jonesprotein and echocardiogram were normal. In-depth assessment by the Infectious Disease team failed to isolate an infective pathogen. Bonemarrow aspirate and trephine were unremarkable. Two CT-guidedbone biopsies done twice showed plasma cells and macrophages. Hiscondition deteriorated rapidly over 2 months. He mobility was reducedto wheelchair-bound and had dramatic 10kg weight loss.ResultsIn the absence of an infective or malignant cause, the Rheumatologyservice was consulted. Having reviewed the extensive data available, he was diagnosed with a likely but unusually aggressive form of adultonset chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). He wascommenced initially on IV methylprednisolone, zoledronic acid, methotrexate and, etoricoxib. Subsequently he was treated with, tocilizumab and teriparatide. Whole body MRI revealed numerousother lesions not evident on previous imaging including lesions of thedistal right humerus, proximal right femur and both tibias. Hissymptoms and inflammatory markers improved substantially overseveral days following treatment. A repeat full body MRI demonstrateddramatic improvement in the bony lesions. Soon he was able to walkagain and gained some weight before he absconded from the hospital.His treatment was changed to tocilizumab infusion and denosumabinjection to facilitate compliance.ConclusionThis is an unusual fascinating case which posed a significantdiagnostic dilemma. Ruling out infection particularly in great challengein diagnosing CRMO in a male adult who is homeless and a heroinabuser presenting with multifocal osteolytic lesions was challenging.The severity of his condition necessitated using novel treatments suchas tocilizumab.","L635215142     2021-06-11 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1093/rheumatology/keab247.041,diamorphine;endogenous compound;etoricoxib;immunoglobulin;methotrexate;methylprednisolone;parathyroid hormone[1-34];tocilizumab;zoledronic acid;abdominal pain;adult;alcohol abuse;aspiration;body weight loss;bone atrophy;case report;chest infection;child;clinical article;communicable disease;conference abstract;drug combination;drug therapy;drug withdrawal;echocardiography;family history;femur;heroin dependence;hip pain;human;human cell;Human immunodeficiency virus;human tissue;humerus;infectious agent;limited mobility;lumbar spine;macrophage;male;nonhuman;osteomyelitis;pelvis;plasma cell;radiography;remission;sternum;thorax pain;tibia;trephine;whole body MRI,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Nguipdop Djomo, Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom","Background Tuberculosis (TB) remains a public health problem in the UK-born population of England, including among young adults. Ecological studies indicate that deprivation is an important risk factor for TB, but there are few recent individual- level studies in high income countries that have investigated the association between poverty-related social determinants of health inequality (SDH) and TB. Our objective was to measure the association between individual socio-economic status and social determinants of health, and TB, taking into account the clustering of social risk factors in individuals, and to estimate the potential population impact on TB rates. Methods Secondary analyses of a nationwide case-control study conducted among UK-born White adults aged 23 to 38 years at diagnosis of their first TB episode, and randomly selected age and sex frequency-matched community controls. Data on some SDH (education, household overcrowding, tobacco smoking, alcohol use, drugs use, and history of homelessness and prison) were collected in face-to-face interviews. Statistical analyses, using logistic regression models, was informed by a theoretical causal framework (Directed Acyclic Graph) of plausible inter-relationships between the measured social factors. Results Overall, 681 TB cases and 1183 controls were recruited. The risk of TB was about four times higher in subjects whose formal education was up to GCSE O-levels or less compared to those with at least a university degree (OR=3.94; 95%CI: 2.74; 5.67), after controlling for other TB risk factors (age, sex, BCG vaccination and stays in Africa or Asia for 33 months). After simultaneously adjusting for these risk factors and all measured social determinants, higher TB risk was also independently associated with tobacco smoking, use of drugs (especially injectable drugs - OR=5.67; 95% CI: 2.68; 11.98), history of homelessness and deprivation in the area of residence. Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) estimates suggested that tobacco use and class-A drug use were, respectively, responsible for 18% and 15% of TB cases in the target population. Conclusion The results provide insight into some of the mechanisms through which deprivation increases the risk of TB in the general population in England and support the argument for improved approaches to TB control efforts, such as integrated health and social services in high-risk young adult populations.","L638508608     2022-07-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/jech-2019-SSMabstracts.44,adult;Africa;age;alcohol consumption;Asia;BCG vaccination;case control study;conference abstract;controlled study;correctional facility;crowding (area);directed acyclic graph;education;educational status;England;female;homelessness;household;human;interview;major clinical study;male;multicenter study;randomized controlled trial;risk assessment;risk factor;secondary analysis;smoking;social determinants of health;social status;social work;theoretical study;tobacco use;tuberculosis;tuberculosis control;young adult;Case-Control Studies;Tuberculosis;European Continental Ancestry Group,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Targeted research is needed to inform future interventions. Socio-demographic characteristics of homeless adults suggest that light smoking may be prevalent, and the relation between smoking level and treatment-related preferences/needs is unknown. The current study addressed these gaps in a sample of homeless smokers. Methods: Participants (N= 237) were homeless adult daily light (1-10 cigarettes per day) and moderate/heavy (>10 cigarettes per day) smokers recruited from a single shelter that offered cessation treatment. Survey items assessed perceived treatment effectiveness, pharmacological intervention preferences, and barriers to quitting smoking. Logistic regressions were used to assess differences in treatment-related factors by smoking level. Results: The prevalence of light smoking (44.7%) was higher than in previously studied samples of domiciled smokers. Relative to moderate/heavy smokers, light smokers smoked for fewer years, had more quit attempts in the last year, and were more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes. They were less likely to believe that medications would give them the greatest chance of quitting and more likely to believe that group counseling would be helpful. Light smokers did not differ from moderate/heavy smokers on specific pharmacological intervention preferences or on perceived barriers to quitting smoking, including craving. Conclusions: The promotion of pharmacotherapy to address cravings may be necessary for light smokers, who represent a sizeable proportion of homeless smokers and who may make apt intervention targets given their higher rates of purposeful quit attempts relative to heavier smoking counterparts.

However, there is recognition of the challenges that prevail to achieve genuine and equitable forms of engagement. Our objective was to identify the mechanisms and resources that enable the reciprocal involvement of seldom heard groups in health and social care research. Methods: A rapid realist review of the literature that included: (a) a systematic search of CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed and Open Grey (2007â€2017); (b) documents provided by expert panel members of relevant journals and grey literature. Six reference panels were undertaken with homeless, women's, transgender, disability and Traveller and Roma organizations to capture local insights. Data were extracted into a theoryâ€based grid linking context to behaviour change policy categories. Main results: From the review, 20 documents were identified and combined with the reference panel summaries. The expert panel reached consensus about 33 programme theories. These relate to environmental and social planning (7); service provision (6); guidelines (4); fiscal measures (6); communication and marketing (4); and regulation and legislation (6). Conclusions: While there is growing evidence of the merits of undertaking PPI, this rarely extends to the meaningful involvement of seldom heard groups. The 33 programme theories agreed by the expert panel point to a variety of mechanisms and resources that need to be considered. Many of the programme theories identified point to the need for a radical shift in current practice to enable the reciprocal involvement of seldom heard groups.

Belgium is in the process of reforming its mental health care delivery system with the aim of simultaneously strengthening community care and improving integration of care. The new policy model attempts to strike a balance between hospitals and community services, and is based on networks of services. We carried out a content analysis of the policy blueprint for the reform and performed an ex-ante evaluation of its plan of operation, based on the current knowledge of mental health service networks. When we examined the policy's multiple aims, intermediate goals, suggested tools, and their articulation, we found that it was unclear how the new policy could achieve its goals. Indeed, deinstitutionalisation and integration of care require different network structures, and different modes of governance. Furthermore, most of the mechanisms contained within the new policy were not sufficiently detailed. Consequently, three major threats to the effectiveness of the reform were identified. These were: issues concerning the relationship between network structure and purpose, the continued influence of hospitals despite the goal of deinstitutionalisation, and the heterogeneity in the actual implementation of the new policy.

Nicholson, RCSI, Dublin, Ireland","BACKGROUND: The Electronic Integrated Text, Visual and Audio Questionnaire (EITVAQ) was designed towards developing a disease-specific tool to measure child health status from a child's perspective. EITVAQ's outcome is anticipated to be positive, introducing a child-friendly health measurement tool. METHODS: This was a prospective crossover pilot study that compared EITVAQ to a printed text 2-paged paper questionnaire (TEXT) format quality of life questionnaire in paediatric hydrocephalus patients. The study was conducted from November 2015 to June 2016 in the Neurosurgical Outpatient Department, Temple Street, Children University Hospital. Data was compiled for both EITVAQ and TEXT and analyzed using Software Package using Statistical Analysis (SPSS). FINDINGS: There was a 100% rate of completion for EITVAQ. However, only 9 (37.5%) of the patients managed to complete the text format. The mean time to complete EITVAQ was 7 minutes. There are 32 questions found in EITVAQ. The mean score for EITVAQ was 132.92 (83%) satisfactory score. Using Pearson Chi-Square Test, the P-Value is 0.341. Although this is not a significantly substantial value, however, patient with less surgical procedure were able to complete EITVAQ 18.9% more than patient with more than 5 surgical procedures.

The ECHO model has been shown to deliver educational benefits and to result in good treatment outcomes for HCV-infected individuals in the USA; however, this approach has not been assessed in a European setting. We sought to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and implementation of the ECHO model in Ireland using a pilot study. We present a descriptive review of recruitment, participation, retention and cost of the intervention as well as a qualitative review of the views of participants on the barriers, benefits and acceptability of the ECHO model. In the original Project ECHO in New Mexico, geographical distance posed the greatest barrier to accessing HCV care. In Ireland, people who inject drugs (PWID) were identified by interviewees as the main group facing barriers to accessing specialist HCV care. State-employed doctors and nurses caring for large numbers of HCV-infected PWID in opiate substitution treatment centres and homeless hostels were successfully recruited to participate in the project. Self-employed general practitioners did not participate, due mainly to a lack of time and the absence of reimbursement for participation.

Methods: Participants were selected from the Boston ARCH cohort (i.e. HIV-infected adults with 12-month DSM-IV substance dependence or ever injection drug use) who were currently taking ART. Substance use predictors of interest included number of DSMIV alcohol and drug dependence criteria and past 30 day substance specific use. Associations with HIV virologic control (HIV viral load [HVL] <200 vs >200 copies/mL) were tested using logistic regression models. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, gender, homelessness and anxiety or depression. Results: Participants (n = 200) were median age 50 years, 67% male, 51% African American, 76% self-reported >90% ART adherence, and 80% HVL <200 copies/mL. In the past 30 days, 52% reported the use of alcohol in heavy amounts, 77% cigarettes, 45% marijuana, 27% cocaine, 16% heroin, and 14% illicit prescription opioids. In unadjusted analyses, both number of DSM-IV alcohol dependence criteria (past 12 months) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.18 for each additional criterion, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.34) and number of DSM-IV drug dependence criteria (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.48), but not alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or illicit opioid use, were associated with a detectable HVL. After adjusting for covariates, only number of drug dependence criteria remained significant (adjusted OR= 1.21, 95% CI: 1.03-1.42). Conclusions: More than 3/4 of an addiction HIV cohort had HIV virologic control and >90% ART adherence. Substance dependence criteria (drug dependence in particular), and not substance specific use, were associated with a lack of virologic control. This suggests that substance dependence criteria warrant particular clinical attention by HIV care providers.","L72176821     2016-02-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.07.445,alcohol;cannabis;cocaine;diamorphine;opiate;substance use;substance abuse;drug dependence;college;Human immunodeficiency virus;human;smoking;United States;African American;anxiety;tobacco;confidence interval;homelessness;male;gender;prescription;model;logistic regression analysis;alcoholism;risk;drug use;addiction;virus load;injection;adult;therapy;Substance-Related Disorders,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Opioid initiation and transition to opioid injection have been studied in urban settings. Little is known about opioid initiation and transition to injection drug use in rural northern New England. Methods: This mixed-methods study characterized opioid use and drug injection in 11 rural counties in Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire between 2018 and 2019. People who use drugs completed audio computer-assisted self-interview surveys on substance use and risk behaviors (n = 589) and shared personal narratives through in-depth interviews (n = 22). The objective of the current study is to describe initiation of opioid use and drug injection in rural northern New England. Results: Median age of first injection was 22 years (interquartile range 18â€“28 years). Key themes from in-depth interviews that led to initiating drug injection included normalization of drug use in families and communities, experiencing trauma, and abrupt discontinuation of an opioid prescription. Other factors that led to a transition to injecting included lower cost, increased effect/ rush, greater availability of heroin/ fentanyl, and faster relief of withdrawal symptoms with injection. Conclusions: Trauma, normalization of drug use, over-prescribing of opioids, and abrupt discontinuation challenge people who use drugs in rural northern New England communities. Inadequate opioid tapering may increase transition to non-prescribed drug use. The extent and severity of traumatic experiences described highlights the importance of enhancing trauma-informed care in rural areas.","L2007836403     2020-09-17     2020-10-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108256,"buprenorphine;cocaine;diamorphine;fentanyl;methamphetamine;opiate;adult;article;cannabis smoking;cigarette smoking;clinical article;controlled study;coping behavior;custodial care;depression;divorce;drug dealing;dysphoria;family history;female;foster care;high risk behavior;homelessness;human;injection drug user;male;medical history;opiate addiction;personal experience;population exposure;prescription;priority journal;prisoner;rape;risk factor;rural area;sexual abuse;spontaneous abortion;suicide;United States;withdrawal syndrome;England;New England;Analgesics, Opioid",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

However, no prior study has specifically examined whether there are racial differences in community integration; similarly, no study has considered racial differences in psychosocial correlates of community integration in homeless Veterans. Knowledge of these factors could inform the development of culturally congruent rehabilitative interventions for Black Veterans. Semi-structured clinical interviews were administered to Black (N = 99) and White (N = 49) homeless Veterans to examine relations among psychiatric symptoms, motivation, and community integration domains (e.g., social integration, work productivity, and independent living). There were no significant racial differences in independent living or work productivity. Black Veterans had better social integration with family compared to White Veterans. In addition, psychiatric symptoms were more strongly correlated with social integration for Black than White Veterans. The association between motivation and work productivity was also stronger for Black Veterans. Recovery-oriented interventions could harness family connections and better target psychiatric symptoms to improve community integration for Black Veterans. Work productivity may improve from interventions aimed at enhancing motivation for Black Veterans.","L2016350496     2022-01-11     2022-02-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114385,adult;African American;agitation;anxiety;article;bipolar disorder;clinical assessment;community integration;controlled study;correlation coefficient;cross-sectional study;depression;European American;exploratory factor analysis;family interaction;female;Hispanic;homeless person;housing;human;independent living;integration;longitudinal study;major clinical study;major depression;male;mania;medical history;mental disease;motivation;posttraumatic stress disorder;productivity;psychosis;race difference;rehabilitation care;semi structured interview;social defeat;transcultural care;veteran;European Continental Ancestry Group;African Continental Ancestry Group,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Community-based abuse liability studies are needed to complement clinical and laboratory data First, we estimate the overall prevalence of misuse (selftreatment) and abuse (euphoria), as well as diversion. We also examine the psychosocial characteristics and differences between methadone and buprenorphine. Methods: Targeted sampling was used to recruit recent (n = 706) persons who inject drugs (PWID), including those receiving some form of outpatient drug treatment (45%) in San Francisco, CA. Final sample matched previous studies in SF, including demographic (53% white, 79% male, 36% ages 30-44, 63% homeless) and behavioral (13% HIV+) characteristics. Results: Approximately 75% were candidates for ORT, based on heroin and/or prescription opioid (540/706) use. Over 30% of opioid addicts reported nonmedical (either euphoria or self-treatment) use of methadone, compared to 9% for buprenorphine. The prevalence of abuse was higher for methadone (75%) than buprenorphine (10%). Conversely, the prevalence for misuse (1-% of abuse) was higher among buprenorphine (90%) than methadone (25%). More outpatient clients reported being treated with methadone (50%) than buprenorphine (10%). Among those receiving outpatient treatment and prescribed methadone, approximately 50% abused their own medication compared to virtually none (<1%) of those being treated with buprenorphine. The significant predictors of nonmedical use that differentiated between misuse versus abuse were being out-of-drug-treatment (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-5.7), cooccurring depression (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2-2.5), PTSD (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1), and high withdrawal severity history (AOR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.01-1.3). There were few differences in the risk factor profiles between buprenorphine and methadone.

This paper explores the socio-political implications of the use of hotels for temporary accommodation, drawing on research conducted in Dublin. Specifically, we argue that the housing of homeless families in hotels exposes how they are made out of place in the city, even in the spaces allocated to house them. Hotels are spaces designed for the respite of others but, for homeless families, they conversely offer no relief and are even actively disruptive to their lives. The paper explores three ways in which hotels, presumed to provide restorative breaks from everyday routines, conversely act as points of rupture for homeless families. First, we consider how hotels are marketed as spaces where social reproductive work can be enjoyably put on hold. However, we argue that these perceived conveniences are experienced as disruptive for families forced to live in hotels for months, even years, at a time. Second, we explore the juxtaposition between the well-being and health benefits hotels are designed to offer guests and the devastating physical and mental health implications for homeless families living in hotels. Third, we compare how hotel management and marketing emphasise the importance of customer service as integral to a hotel's success, while simultaneously shaming and stigmatising homeless residents. The paper concludes by calling for greater attention to be paid to how hotels, normally considered sites of rest, become sites of rupture when used as temporary accommodation, exacerbating the stigmatisation and threats to well-being that homeless families suffer.

The study aim was to investigate whether service users experience different homeless services as affording or constraining capabilities. We conducted semi-structured interviews with homeless service users (n = 77) in Housing First (HF) and staircase services (SS) in eight European countries. We used thematic analysis to identify three themes: autonomy and dependency, the relational impact of living arrangements, and community interaction and stigma. While SS participants were able to address their bodily integrity and health, their higher-order capabilities were constrained by their homeless situations. HF participants described home as a base from which they could enact a wide range of capabilities indicative of a well-lived life. We conclude that housing-led service models with appropriate supports are key to affording service users' capabilities. Practical and policy implications are discussed.

From 2014-2021, a 165% increase was observed in families accessing emergency homeless accommodation in Ireland, causing a 211% increase in child homelessness. In March 2021, there were 913 homeless families in Ireland, with children (n=2,326) accounting for 28% of homeless people. Over-represented vulnerable groups include Irish Travellers, the Roma, and international protection applicants. Homeless populations are more likely to use emergency departments (EDs) rather than primary care, with higher admission rates and durations. Most literature pertains to lone adult homelessness. Objectives To compare emergency presentations between homeless and non-homeless children, to investigate differences in demographics, vaccination, service usage, medical acuity, diagnoses and outcomes. Methods We performed a retrospective review of homeless children attending a tertiary paediatric emergency department in Dublin, Ireland, from 01/01/2017 - 31/12/2020. Homelessness was defined as those with addresses of no fixed abode, government homeless accommodation, direct provision, women's refuges, drug rehabilitation centres, children's residential homes, and prison. Those who provided residential addresses but were functionally homeless were also included. Comparison was made with non-homeless children attending in 2019. Data was extracted from electronic healthcare records, and analysed using SPSS. Hospital ethical approval was obtained. Results From 01/01/2017-31/12/2020, 3,138 homeless children presented, representing 1.6% of total attendances. Compared to non-homeless (n=1,500), homeless children were younger (29 vs 60 months, p<0.001; proportion â‰¤12 months: 25.7% vs 16.3%, p<0.001). Homeless children were less likely to have Irish ethnicity (37.4% vs 74.6%, p<0.001), or have been born in Ireland (82.3% versus 96.2%, p<0.001). Ethnicity varied between homeless and non-homeless (White Irish: 34.5% vs 73.7%; Irish Traveller: 3% vs 0.8%; Roma: 22.5% vs 2.4%; Black: 21.1% vs 4.2%; Asian: 8.6% vs 8.8%; White European 5.9% vs 9%; p<0.001). Homeless children were more likely to re-present (15.9% vs 10.5%, p<0.001), use ambulances (13.2% vs 6.7%, p<0.001), and have â‰¥4 ED attendances in 6 months (9.7% versus 5.4%, p<0.001), while being less likely to have registered GPs (89.7% versus 95.8%, p<0.001). Compared to non-homeless, homeless children were overrepresented in lower triage categories (4: 48.5% vs 41.5%; 5: 2% vs 0.8%; p<0.001), ED discharges (93.6% vs 91.1%, p=0.002), and leaving prior to assessment (5% vs 3.7%, p=0.046), while having longer admissions (median duration: 3 vs 2 days, p=0.001). Vaccination status varied between homeless and non-homeless children (complete: 73.6% vs 81.9%; incomplete 18.5% vs 13.7%; unvaccinated: 3% vs 0.9%, p<0.001). There were no differences in gender or past medical history. Conclusions Although homeless children were less likely to have Irish ethnicity, 82.3% had been born in Ireland, with over-representation of Irish Traveller, Roma and black ethnicities, which compares with national data. Homeless children were less likely to have GPs, and be fully vaccinated. They had increased use of emergency services despite having lower triage categories, higher discharge rates, and no differences in past medical history. Vulnerable groups remain over-represented in the Irish paediatric homeless population. As with adults, paediatric homeless populations rely heavily on emergency services, being less likely to engage with primary healthcare.","L636341539     2021-11-02 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Conference Abstract,Health care - Use (ED) | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Data included in other studies",10.1136/archdischild-2021-rcpch.428,"adult;ambulance;child;conference abstract;correctional facility;data analysis software;demography;emergency health service;emergency ward;ethnicity;female;gender;government;homeless person;homeless youth;human;Ireland;major clinical study;male;medical history;outcome assessment;primary health care;rehabilitation center;residential home;retrospective study;Romani (people);travel;vaccination;Only Child;Child;Emergency Service, Hospital;Emergencies",,,N,N,Full text screen

Electronic address: sharon.lambert@ucc.ie.","INTRODUCTION: This paper explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care professionals who support clients experiencing addiction. During the pandemic, addiction support became more challenging, as existing health care models had changed or been completely abolished. Clients continued to engage with social, justice, and health services in limited capacities, connecting with general practitioners, key workers, homelessness support workers, and other service providers. This marginalized population was among the most high-risk groups for adverse health outcomes during the pandemic and understanding the associated implications for practitioner well-being is crucial. METHODS: Fifteen health care professionals who work with active addiction in homelessness, public health, addiction, emergency medicine, and other areas participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Data analyses utilized reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four core themes emerged from the analysis: (i) Shift in Priority, (ii) Being Left Behind, (iii) Managing a Death, and (iv) Anxious Environment. Within each core theme, associated subthemes provide further context. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the well-being of clinicians who work with people who use drugs, fostering a more anxious environment and compounding what can already be a high-stress occupation. Participants exhibited high levels of concern for the well-being of clients, and uncertainty permeated throughout conversations. Furthermore, staff expressed concern for their own well-being in the long term due to the inability to process adverse events, such as a service user's death, due to the chaotic nature of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights some areas of concern to address for future service delivery and presents opportunities to future-proof services as the world moves toward hybrid models of working. The inflexibility of service provision during the pandemic and the digital divide due to public health measures pushed marginalized groups further into the margins, with significant implications for practitioner occupational well-being due to feelings of anxiety, powerlessness, and concern for mortality of clients. This study collects a broad scope of experiences across disciplines in health care and demonstrates how professionals navigated unprecedented circumstances.","1873-6483     O'Callaghan, Daniel     Lambert, Sharon     Journal Article     United States     J Subst Abuse Treat. 2022 Jul;138:108720. doi: 10.1016/j.jsat.2022.108720.

This study examines aspects of physical and mental health, perceived quality of life and health service use among homeless illicit drug users and compares these to non-drug users. Methods: Participants were recruited through health clinics across Dublin. A questionnaire assessed participants' drug use, health and well-being, health behaviours and use of health services. Descriptive statistics are presented for the entire cohort and drug users separately. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between drug use and (i) multimorbidity, (ii) anxiety and/or depression, (iii) perceived quality of life and (iv) use of health services. Results: Of 105 participants recruited, 35 (33%) were current drug users. Current and previous drug users were significantly more likely to have multimorbidity than those who had never taken drugs (OR 4.86, 95% CI 1.00-23.66). There was no significant difference between drug users and non-drug users in the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression. Drug users were five times more likely than non-drug users to have a low perceived quality of life (OR 5.2,95% Cl 1.7-16.0). Health service utilization was high, although some services were used less by drug users (e.g., dentist and psychiatric outpatient services) while others were used more often (e.g., phoneline services and day care centres). Conclusion: This study highlights the high levels of drug use in this population and the negative impact of drug use on health and perceived quality of life of a homeless population in Dublin.

The experience, if borne out by further research, provides important lessons for policy discussions on the pandemic, as well as broader lessons about pragmatic responses to these key client groups irrespective of COVID-19. The overarching lesson seems that when government policy is well coordinated and underpinned by a science-driven and fundamentally pragmatic approach, morbidity and mortality can be reduced. Within this, the importance of strategic clarity and delivery, housing, lowered thresholds to methadone provision, Benzodiazepine (BZD) provision and Naloxone availability were key determinants of policy success. Further, this paper argues that the rapid collapse in policy barriers to these interventions that COVID-19 produced should be secured and protected while further research is conducted.","1873-4758     O'Carroll, Austin     Duffin, Tony     Collins, John     Journal Article     Netherlands     Int J Drug Policy. 2021 Jan;87:102966. doi: 10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102966.

A mobile health clinic, staffed by GP registrars, was developed to provide services to homeless people, particularly rough sleepers and sex workers. AIM: The aims were to improve access to primary care and to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices of GP registrars through direct contact with homeless people. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a qualitative study; questionnaires were completed on the mobile health clinic and two focus groups were conducted. METHODS: All service users were asked to complete a questionnaire over a 3Â month period. Two focus groups were conducted with 6 and 14 GP registrars who had worked on the bus. RESULTS: There was an 80% response rate (116 of 145). Fifty-two percent had no Medical Card meaning that they had no way to access the free primary care to which they are entitled. Had the clinic not been available, over half would not have sought further treatment and 16% would have gone to an Emergency Department. Ninety-one percent of users rated the service 10/10. The focus groups found that GP registrars who worked on the mobile health clinic had decreased negative stereotypes, increased empathy, and more knowledge of homeless issues. Furthermore, they intended to ensure that homeless people will not face discrimination in their future practice. CONCLUSION: A GP Registrar-run Mobile Health Clinic achieved its aims of improving access to primary care for rough sleepers and sex workers, and challenging stereotypes of GP Registrars.","1863-4362     O'Carroll, A     Irving, N     O'Neill, J     Flanagan, E     Journal Article     Review     Ireland     Ir J Med Sci. 2017 Aug;186(3):541-546. doi: 10.1007/s11845-016-1527-2.

Their health service utilisation (HSU) is typified by: late illness presentations; poor attendance rates at appointments; low usage of primary care services and outpatient departments; and high utilisation of emergency departments and inpatient services. Why people experiencing homelessness have these particular HSU patterns is poorly understood. AIM: This research sought to explore barriers to health service usage for people experiencing homelessness. DESIGN & SETTING: The authors conducted critical realist ethnography over 13 months in Dublin with people experiencing homelessness at four purposively chosen sites (a food hall, a drop-in centre, an emergency department, and an outreach service for rough sleepers). METHOD: Ethnographic research was supplemented with focus groups of hospital doctors and people experiencing homelessness, and with 50 semi-structured interviews with people experiencing homelessness. The epistemological framework was critical realism. RESULTS: One of the factors identified in the research as contributing to the HSU pattern of people experiencing homelessness was recurrent interactions between health professionals and patients, whereby patients were either excluded or discouraged from attending health services, or self-excluded themselves from services. These interactions were described as 'conversations of exclusion'. Four such conversations were described: 'the benzodiazepine conversation'; 'the mistrustful conversation'; 'the blaming conversation'; and 'the assertive conversation'. CONCLUSION: There are certain recurrent interactions between people experiencing homelessness and doctors that result in the exclusion of people experiencing homelessness from health services.","2398-3795     O'Carroll, Austin     Orcid: 0000-0003-3936-5042     Wainwright, David     Journal Article     England     BJGP Open. 2021 Jun 30;5(3):BJGPO.2021.0031. doi: 10.3399/BJGPO.2021.0031.

This study sought to understand why they use health services differently from the domiciled population. METHODS: Ethnographic observations were conducted at several homeless services, in Dublin. This was supplemented with 47 semi-structured interviews with homeless people and two focus groups of homeless people and hospital doctors. A critical-realist approach was adopted for interpretation of the data. RESULTS: Homeless people tended to present late in their illness; default early from treatment; have low usage of primary-care, preventative and outpatient services; have high usage of Emergency and Inpatient services; and poor compliance with medication. They tended to avoid psychiatric services. A number of external barriers were identified. These were classified as physical (distance) administrative (application process for medical care; appointments; queues; the management of addiction in hospital; rules of service; and information providing processes); and attitudinal (stigma; differing attitudes as to appropriate use of services. A new form of barrier, Conversations of Exclusion was identified and described. Internalised barriers were identified which were in nature, either cognitive (fatalistic, denial, deferral to future, presumption of poor treatment or discrimination, self blame and survival cognitions) or emotional (fear; embarrassment, hopelessness and poor self-esteem). Generative mechanisms for these factors were identified which either affected participants prior to homelessness (marginalization causing hopelessness, familial dysfunction, substance misuse, fear of authority, illiteracy; mental health; and poor English) or after becoming homeless (homelessness; ubiquity of premature death; substance misuse; prioritization of survival over health; threat of violence; chaotic nature of homelessness; negative experiences of authority; and stigma. CONCLUSIONS: An explanatory critical realist model integrating the identified generative mechanisms, external and internalised barriers was developed to explain why the Health service Utilization of homeless people differs from the domiciled populations. This new model has implications for health service policy makers and providers in how they design and deliver accessible health services to homeless people.","1475-9276     O'Carroll, Austin     Orcid: 0000-0003-3936-5042     Wainwright, David     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     Int J Equity Health. 2019 Jul 23;18(1):113. doi: 10.1186/s12939-019-1002-6. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Use",10.1186/s12939-019-1002-6,Adult;*Attitude to Health;Female;Focus Groups;Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data;Homeless Persons/*psychology/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Ireland;Male;Mental Disorders/psychology;Mental Health/statistics & numerical data;Primary Health Care/*organization & administration;*Self Concept;Social Support;Surveys and Questionnaires;Vulnerable Populations/*psychology;Health Services;Health Services Needs and Demand,,,Y,N,Included

We aimed to describe the emergency department (ED) presentations of IDUs. METHODS: In a prospective observational study over a 3-month period, we identified characteristics of patients with a history of active IDU presenting to the ED. RESULTS: From 1 January 2010 to 31 March 2010, 146 patients with a history of IDU were identified. These contributed to 222 acute presentations to the ED. Baseline characteristics revealed that patients were predominantly male, of Irish nationality, with high levels of homelessness, unemployment and lack of stable family or intimate partner relationships. 45% of presentations occurred as a result of infection (95% CI 38.5% to 51.5%). Trauma, pure toxicological issues, thromboembolic phenomena and psychiatric issues comprised the other common acute diagnoses. The burden of comorbid medical illness was substantial with high rates of hepatitis C infection (74%) and HIV infection (13.8%). Healthcare utilisation indices for this cohort are extreme on multiple measures. We found an ED attendance rate of 445 per 100 patient-years, an admission rate of 68.8 per 100 patient-years and mortality rate of 4.86 per 100 patient-years.

Homeless people often report negative experi-ences in hospitals. 40% of homeless ED attenders leave before being assessed by the ED staff, compared to only 15% of housed individuals. We sought to describe the characteristics of homeless patients and their experiences of community and hospital staff and services. Methods: Ethical approval was obtained and informed consent was sought verbally from all patients. Patients included in the study were interviewed about their time spent in hospital, life experiences leading up to admission and access to health services. Patients were asked what they would change and what they would like to see happen in hospital. A questionnaire with both open and closed questions was used. Permission was given for the interviews to be recorded. Results: 10 patients were interviewed. 6 were male, 4 were female. 8/10 were cur-rently injecting drugs. All patients reported difficulties with waiting for methadone or chlordiazepoxide while in ED. 8/10 patients reported difficulties obtaining clean clothes while an inpatient. 5/10 reported feeling that they were treated differently to other patients. Patient suggestions included provision of free televisions and improved management of drug/alcohol withdrawals. Conclusions: Homeless patients make up a significant proportion of presentations to the emergency department in St James Hospital and indeed of the overall inpatient population. These patients frequently have adverse experiences of care.

The meanings of the phrase ""social exclusion"", and the closely associated term ""social inclusion"", are contested in the literature. Both of these concepts are important in relation to health and the area of primary healthcare in particular. Thus, several tools for the measurement of social exclusion or social inclusion status in health care settings have been developed. Methods: A scoping review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted to examine tools developed since 2000 that measure social exclusion or social inclusion. We focused on those measurement tools developed for use with individual patients in healthcare settings. Efforts were made to obtain a copy of each of the original tools, and all relevant background literature. All tools retrieved were compared in tables, and the specific domains that were included in each measure were tabulated. Results: Twenty-two measurement tools were included in the final scoping review. The majority of these had been specifically developed for the measurement of social inclusion or social exclusion, but a small number were created for the measurement of other closely aligned concepts. The majority of the tools included were constructed for engaging with patients in mental health settings. The tools varied greatly in their design, the scoring systems and the ways they were administered. The domains covered by these tools varied widely and some of the tools were quite narrow in the areas of focus. A review of the definitions of both social inclusion and social exclusion also revealed the variations among the explanations of these complex concepts. Conclusions: There are several definitions of both social inclusion and social exclusion in use and they differ greatly in scope. While there are many tools that have been developed for measuring these concepts in healthcare settings, these do not have a primary healthcare focus. There is a need for the development of a tool for measuring social inclusion or social exclusion in primary healthcare settings.","L620426553     2018-02-09     2018-12-27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1186/s12939-018-0732-1,Activity and Participation Questionnaire 6;Australian Community Participation Questionnaire;Community Integration Measure Questionnaire;Composite Measure of Social Inclusion;disability;EMILIA Project Questionnaire;Evaluating Social Inclusion Questionnaire;health care;Homeless Outcomes Star;homelessness;human;Inclusion Web;Living in the Community Questionnaire;measurement;mental health care;Mental Health Recovery Star;methodology;migrant;Multidimensional Social Inclusion;Participation Scale;priority journal;review;scoping review;scoring system;Social and Community Opportunities Profile;Social and Community Opportunities Profile Chinese version;social aspects and related phenomena;social exclusion;social inclusion;Social Inclusion Questionnaire;Social Inclusion Questionnaire User Experience;Social Inclusion Scale Measure;Social Inclusion Scale Social Inclusion Measure;Social Integration Survey;Staff Survey of Social Inclusion;Support Needs Questionnaire;The Human Givens;traumatic brain injury;Vulnerability Assessment Tool,,,N,N,Full text screen

Many measurement tools developed looked at people from single excluded groups in isolation. We know from experience and literature that exclusion is often intersectional and multi-layered. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop a social exclusion measurement tool for use in healthcare settings with individuals from any excluded group that would include questions to investigate socioeconomic elements and subjective experiences in their lives. Methods Inductive and deductive methods were used to develop the tool. Early drafts were tested with experts (both academic and experts by experience) and modified in line with feedback received. The tool was then piloted with people in the community, and this allowed us to assess the internal consistency and validity of the tool. Exploratory factor analysis was carried out as part of this evaluation. Results The measurement tool was initially evaluated by 17 academic and 'real world' experts. It was then piloted with seven experts by experience, two gatekeepers and two participants who were presumed not to be excluded, resulting in the development of the final tool. This was then tested with 276 participants (127 presumed excluded, 149 presumed not excluded). The socioeconomic characteristics of these participants were documented, and exploratory factor analysis was carried out on data relating to subjective items. A four-factor structure emerged comprising 22 items. Internal consistency of the factors was high, and their ability to discriminate between the two groups was notable. Conclusions A tool for measuring the social exclusion of individuals has been developed by engaging with people from a variety of excluded groups. Socioeconomic indicators were combined with subjective items. The input of experts by experience, academics and others was sought to enhance the tool. The tool was applied to two distinct samples, showing obvious differences both in the socioeconomic items, and the items included in the factor analysis. The potential use of this tool could have positive implications for people who are excluded.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 63 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: SDOH - stigma,Health care - Quality",10.1186/s12939-022-01636-1,Social exclusion;Health;Intersectionality;Scale development;Tool evaluation;INCLUSION HEALTH;COMMUNITY INTEGRATION;HOMELESS;PEOPLE;TIES,,,Y,Y,Included

National Social Inclusion Office, Primary Care Division, Health Service Executive, Mill Lane, Palmerstown, Dublin 20, Ireland.","BACKGROUND: The involvement of patients and the public in healthcare has grown significantly in recent decades and is documented in health policy documents internationally. Many benefits of involving these groups in primary care planning have been reported. However, these benefits are rarely felt by those considered marginalised in society and they are often excluded from participating in the process of planning primary care. It has been recommended to employ suitable approaches, such as co-operative and participatory initiatives, to enable marginalised groups to highlight their priorities for care. METHODS: This Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) research study involved 21 members of various marginalised groups who contributed their views about access to primary care. Using a series of PLA techniques for data generation and co-analysis, we explored barriers and facilitators to primary healthcare access from the perspective of migrants, Irish Travellers, homeless people, drug users, sex workers and people living in deprivation, and identified their priorities for action with regard to primary care provision. RESULTS: Four overarching themes were identified: the home environment, the effects of the 'two-tier' healthcare system on engagement, healthcare encounters, and the complex health needs of many in those groups. The study demonstrates that there are many complicated personal and structural barriers to accessing primary healthcare for marginalised groups. There were shared and differential experiences across the groups. Participants also expressed shared priorities for action in the planning and running of primary care services. CONCLUSIONS: Members of marginalised groups have shared priorities for action to improve their access to primary care. If steps are taken to address these, there is scope to impact on more than one marginalised group and to address the existing health inequities.","1475-9276     O'Donnell, Patrick     Orcid: 0000-0001-7710-7832     Tierney, Edel     O'Carroll, Austin     Nurse, Diane     MacFarlane, Anne     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     Int J Equity Health. 2016 Dec 3;15(1):197. doi: 10.1186/s12939-016-0487-5. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Access",10.1186/s12939-016-0487-5,*Drug Users;Female;Health Planning;Health Policy;*Health Services Accessibility;Health Services Needs and Demand;Health Services Research;*Homeless Persons;Humans;Male;*Poverty;*Primary Health Care;Qualitative Research;*Sex Workers;Social Marginalization;*Transients and Migrants;Access;Equity;Hard to reach;Marginalised groups;Participatory research;Patient and public involvement (PPI);Primary healthcare;Vulnerable groups;Primary Health Care,,,Y,N,Included

Sharpe, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","Introduction: Childhood obesity is a rapidly growing issue worldwide today. As of 2017, in Ireland at least 1 in 5 children are overweight or obese.1 Studies have suggested that macrosomic infants are at increased risk of developing childhood obesity.2 Fetal macrosomia is defined as a birthweight >4000 g.3 The 2014 Irish census revealed that 15.39% of babies were born >4000 g,4 however, international data has cited rates as low as 7.5%. Aim: To determine whether a cohort of children attending a paediatric weight management clinic had a higher incidence of macrosomia at birth compared against the national average. Method: A retrospective cohort study design examining patients that had attended a weight management programme in Temple Street Children's University Hospital from January to December 2016 and observing the presence of macrosomia at birth. Results: Out of 135 patients, 28 were recorded as having a birth weight >4000 g (20.7%). From these 28 patients, 19 were grade 1, 7 were grade 2 and 2 were grade 3. 17 were male (60.7%) and 11 were female (39.3%). Conclusion: There is a higher incidence of macrosmia in patients with a BMI >98th percentile attending a weight management clinic than in the national average (20.7% vs 15.39%). Discussion: Our result implies association between macrosomia and childhood obesity. By expanding the cohort to include children attending a weight management programme over more than one year, this would strengthen the accuracy of our results. By selecting a cohort from one year of the programme, the sample size was limited to 230 people. Additionally, this observational study was dependent on birth weight recordings in patient charts which was subject to recall bias.","L628681110     2019-08-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1136/archdischild-2019-epa.857,birth weight;body mass;child;childhood obesity;cohort analysis;conference abstract;congenital disorder;controlled study;female;homeless youth;human;incidence;infant;Ireland;macrosomia;major clinical study;male;observational study;recall bias;retrospective study;sample size;university hospital;Only Child;Child,,,N,N,Full text screen

Methods: We conducted a repeat cross-sectional survey of IDUs accessing harm reduction services in Glasgow in 2005 and 2007. We measured self-reported weekly alcohol consumption, excess drinking (defined as exceeding the UK Royal College of Physician's guidelines for safe drinking of 14 units/week for women and 21 units/week for men) and HCV antibodies (anonymously in oral fluid). Results: Among IDUs who tested HCV antibody positive, 65% drank alcohol and 29% drank to excess, compared to 61% (p = 0.3) and 18% (p < 0.001) of those who tested negative, respectively. IDUs who self-reported as HCV positive were less likely to drink but as likely to drink to excess as self-reported negatives or those with HCV status unknown, both among all IDUs and those who tested HCV antibody positive. Among the antibody positives, excess drinking was associated with incarceration (aOR = 2.56; 95% CI: 1.28-5.12), homelessness within six months of interview (aOR = 3.60; 95% CI: 2.00-6.48) and homelessness more than six months before interview (aOR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.06-3.53). Conclusions: IDUs who believe they are HCV infected are more likely to, abstain from alcohol, but those who drink continue to do so to excess. IDUs diagnosed with HCV need greater support to reduce their alcohol consumption. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

O'Malley, Temple Street Childrens University Hospital, Physiotherapy, Dublin, Ireland","Relevance: Obesity is a global epidemic. Behavioral change approaches towards improving nutrition, increasing physical activity level, improving sleep, and reducing sitting time are recommended as best practices in adolescent obesity management. However, access to evidence-based treatment is limited and portable technologies such as mobile apps may provide a useful platform to deliver such lifestyle interventions. No evidence-based validated app exists for obesity intervention; therefore, a novel mobile app (Reactivate) was developed for use in the Temple Street W82GO Healthy Lifestyles Program (W82GO). Purpose: This study aimed to test the usability (technical effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction) of the Reactivate mobile app in obese adolescents. Methods/analysis: Ten adolescents (7 males and 3 females, aged 12-17 years) who had been treated for obesity (>98th percentile for body mass index) at the Temple Street Children's University Hospital were recruited. Participants were given 8 tasks to complete in order to test the technical effectiveness of the app. A research assistant timed the user while completing each task in order to test the relative user efficiency of the app (time-on-task). The tasks fell into 5 categories and required the user to enter personal settings, find and answer surveys, create a message, use the goal setting feature, and enter details regarding their weight and height. In exploration of user satisfaction, each participant completed the standardized software usability measurement inventory (SUMI), which measures 5 aspects of user satisfaction: efficiency, effect, helpfulness, controllability, and learnability. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the mean relative user efficiency and SUMI scores. Results: Mean age was 14.26 (SD 1.58) years. All adolescents completed each of the tasks successfully. The mean relative user efficiency scores were two to three times that of an expert user. Users responded that they would use Reactivate to monitor their growth over time, for motivation, and for goal setting. All users described Reactivate as an important mobile app. Discussion and conclusions: Our study describes the usability of a mobile app used in adolescent obesity management. Adolescents found Reactivate easy to use and their SUMI results indicated that the app scored high on user satisfaction. Usability testing is an important step towards refining the development of the Reactivate app, which can be used in the treatment of obesity. The study on the clinical efficacy of the Reactivate app is currently underway. Impact and implications: Developing and evaluating evidence-based mobile-health interventions is of key importance in the scaling up behaviour change interventions for self-management of chronic disease.","L614123232     2017-01-24 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.physio.2016.10.363,adolescent;adolescent obesity;behavior change;body mass;child;chronic disease;comparative effectiveness;cooperation;evidence based practice center;female;healthy lifestyle;height;homeless youth;human;major clinical study;male;mobile application;motivation;satisfaction;scale up;school child;scientist;self care;statistics;university hospital;Adolescent,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

A common strategy for preventing unintended pregnancies among these women is to increase their use of long acting reversible contraception (LARC). This study assessed the pregnancy history and contraceptive use of women attending Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare for opioid substitution therapy, and their access to contraceptive services. The need for a contraceptive service within the addiction services at Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare was evaluated. Methods: The study utilized a cross-sectional survey administered by healthcare providers to 39 women ages 18-50 attending Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare for opioid substitution therapy. Results were compared to Irish national data on pregnancy history and contraception use. Results: 79% of participants had unintended pregnancies, and 23% had 3 or more unintended pregnancies. Of the participants' children, 35% lived with their mother, 37% lived in care, and 24% lived with another family member. 31% of participants had never used LARC. 22.5% of participants reported never having received information on pregnancy prevention and 25.6% reported never having received information on STI prevention. 92% of participants reported that they would use a contraceptive service if it were provided within the addiction services at Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare. Discussion: This study highlights the need to increase contraceptive services for women attending addiction services at Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare. Addiction services are ideal locations to also access contraceptive services because service users already attend these clinics frequently for treatment, and thus have continuity of care with healthcare providers.","L629409129     2019-09-30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Contraception,Conference Abstract",10.1186/s12919-019-0167-8,contraceptive agent;adult;child;clinical article;conference abstract;contraceptive behavior;controlled study;drug dependence;female;health care personnel;human;opiate substitution treatment;patient care;prevention;unplanned pregnancy;Community Health Services,,,Y,N,Included

Wicklow, Greystones, Ireland","Presents an obituary of Thomas Stephen Szasz (1920-2012). Szasz viewed mental health problems as problems in living rather than disorders since there was no consistent pathology as is found with neurological disease. Szasz was a hugely influential figure to the liberal wing of the American legal profession. He was quoted widely in the successful campaign to reduce the avenues open to psychiatrists who believe a patient requires involuntary admission to hospital. Szasz did not want to see patients unless they wanted to see him. A skilled writer, Szasz would pair an obviously odious historical event with involuntary admission of patients so that the latter became tarnished by association. The current high levels of untreated mental illness, homelessness, the exploding prison population, and the emphasis on rights rather than treatment needs can be traced in large measure to Szasz and his acolytes.

O'Sullivan, Temple Street Children's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland","Introduction: Differentiation between plagiocephaly and cranio-synostosis continues to provide a challenge for the clinician. Historically, initial investigations would have included a skull x-ray. However, it is widely accepted that this investigation is difficult to interpret and its value in diagnosis of craniosynostosis is debated. Aside from creating the burden of additional investigations, it also exposes children to ionising radiation. Aim and Objectives: Examine the correlation between reported skull x-rays and clinical diagnosis of craniosynostosis to establish their diagnostic value and value in management of abnormal skull shape. Methods: Retrospective chart review conducted as a 2 part study in children who were referred with a skull x-ray. Part A: Referrals of abnormal skull shapes to the National Pediatric Craniofacial Center (NPCC), Temple Street Children's Hospital, between 1st January 2015 and 30th May 2017 Part B: Children who underwent surgery for a confirmed craniosynostosis between 1st January 2011-25th October 2017. Results and Findings: Part A: 300 children were referred with 59 skull x-rays. This represented 20% of all patients referred during the time period. Of these 44 (75%) were found to be a match with 15 (25%) not matching the final clinical diagnosis. Part B: 274 children underwent surgery for a confirmed craniosynostosis between 1st January 2011-25th October 2017. 63 pts had skull x-rays on referral-this represents 23% of all operated children in the time period. Of these 41 (63%) were found to be a match with 17 (29%) not matching the final clinical diagnosis. 5 (8%) were inconclusive. Conclusions: Part A: In 25% of the children referred to the NPCC with abnormal skull shape, their clinical diagnosis did not match their x-ray report. As such, skull x-rays did not contribute to their management. Part B: In 35% of children who underwent surgery for craniosynostosis, their clinical diagnosis did not match their radiological diagnosis. In the remaining children who had a skull x-ray performed and underwent surgery for craniosynostosis, the majority (88%) had a subtype of craniosynostosis which our clinical team who feel confident to diagnosis clinically without imaging. As such, it can be said that in 92% of children who underwent surgery at the NPCC the x-ray did not contribute to their management. We recommend clinicians should check with the NPCC with respect to the protocol for x-rays where craniosynostosis is suspected as in most cases the diagnosis is clinically obvious to the craniofacial surgeon.","L628695195     2019-08-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/archdischild-2019-epa.76,child;clinician;conference abstract;controlled study;craniofacial synostosis;diagnosis;diagnostic value;female;homeless youth;human;major clinical study;male;medical record review;patient referral;plagiocephaly;radiodiagnosis;retrospective study;skull radiography;surgeon;surgery;Skull,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

O'Reilly, Partnership for Health Equity, Irish College of General Practice, Dublin, Ireland","Background: A 2001 UK study found non-deprived areas had almost twice the amount of applicants for GP posts as deprived areas which resulted in difficulties filling 68% of urban deprived posts compared to 29% rural posts. It is also known that marginalized groups have the worst health indices and have difficult accessing primary care. The North Dublin City GP training programme in Ireland was set up in 2009 specifically to train GPs to work in areas of deprivation and with marginalized groups. Research question: How is the training programme meeting its aim to develop GPs with the desire and capacity to work in areas of deprivation and what impact is this having? Methods: A mixed methods descriptive study has been implemented to capture GP trainees' reflections and changes to attitudes as they progress through this innovative training programme. Focus group, reflective journals and pre and postattitudinal surveys were examined. The structured programmed was reviewed and described. Follow-up of graduates was conducted. Video feedback from GP trainees was also captured. Results: Preliminary data demonstrates that GP registrars actively seek to include deprived and marginal groups in their practice post graduating. Data demonstrates changes in attitudes. These posts involve GP registrars working one day a week for four months in homeless primary care services; another day in prison and ethnic minority primary care services; and another in drug treatment services. The educational theory for these posts is based on the contact hypothesis which proposes that contact breaks down stereotypes. Videos of registrar feedback on these posts demonstrate this. Conclusion: This innovative programme has produced results that suggest that, through training, GPs can be better equipped with capacity and desire to work in areas of disadvantage and marginalized groups. Expansion of this model of training is recommended.","L621478032     2018-04-04 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Quality",10.1080/13814788.2017.1300653,conference abstract;educational theory;ethnic group;follow up;human;preliminary data;primary medical care;correctional facility;stereotypy;student;training;videorecording;P-Glycoprotein,,,Y,N,Included

Women with opioid use disorders who have unintended pregnancies face unique challenges. A common strategy for preventing unintended pregnancies among these women is to increase their use of long acting reversible contraception (LARC), especially the implant and intrauterine device. This study aimed to assess the pregnancy history, contraceptive use and access to contraceptive services of women attending Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare (CKCH) for opioid replacement therapy. The need for a contraceptive service within the Addiction Services at CKCH was evaluated. Methods. The study utilized a cross-sectional survey administered by healthcare providers to 39 women, ages 1850, attending CKCH for opioid replacement therapy. Descriptive statistics were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Data Editor. Results. 79.5% of participants had unintended pregnancies, and 23% had 3 or more unintended pregnancies. Of the participants' children, 35% lived with their mother, 37% lived in care, and 24% lived with another family member. 31% of participants reported never having used LARC. 18% of participants reported never having received information on pregnancy prevention and 21% reported never having received information on STI prevention. 92% of participants reported that they would use a contraceptive service if it were provided within the addiction services at CKCH. Conclusions. This study highlights the need to increase contraceptive services for women attending CKCH for opioid replacement therapy. Addiction services are ideal locations to also access contraceptive services because service-users already attend these clinics frequently for treatment, and thus have continuity of care with healthcare providers.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 1 Total Times Cited: 1 Cited Reference Count: 18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Contraception | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Duplicate",,"Opioid-replacement therapy;unintended pregnancy;long acting reversible contraception (LARC);Cross-Sectional Studies;Analgesics, Opioid;Cesarean Section",,,N,N,Full text screen

Ã“Malley, Temple Street Childrens University Hospital, Ireland","Introduction: Risk factors for cardiovascular disease have been identifed by fve years of age in children who are overweight (Flynn et al 2006). The beneft of high levels of childhood cardiorespiratory ftness on cardiovascular health in adulthood is well known (Ruiz et al. 2015) and improving activity levels and ftness in children leads to improved cardiovascular and metabolic profiles (Woo et al., 2004).Tis study explored the cardiorespi-ratory ftness, risk of hypertension and the relationship between obesity and ftness in children attending an obesity clinic. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted involving children and adolescents with a bmi â‰¥98thpercentile referred for obesity treatment at Temple Street Children's University Hospital. Height and weight were measured and bmi (Kg/M2), bmi centiles and bmi sds were calculated (uk90). Cardiorespiratory ftness was measured with a mod-ifed Balke Treadmill test to 90% age-predicted heart-rate max and vo-2peak measures were estimated using established equations (acsm, 2000). Troughout the exercise test, heart rate, and rate of perceived exhaustion (borg) were recorded. Blood pressure (bp) readings were recorded pre and post exercise test in the sitting position. Age- and gender- adjusted bp percentiles were calculated using pre-test bp measurements and the risk of hypertension was defned according to established guidelines. Results: The mean age of the children (n = 316) was 11.72 years (sd+/-3.03) and mean bmi sds and bmi Percentile were 3.15 (sd+/- 0.6) and 99.7 (sd+/- 0.7). Sixty-one percent of children referred (N = 195) completed an exercise test with 30% (N = 59) managing to reach their 90% hr max. Mean estimated vo2peak was 24.69 ml/kg/min (+/-5.4) for girls and 26.6 ml/kg/min (+/-12.4) for boys. In those that undertook the exercise test, ffeen percent (N = 29) were at risk of pre-hypertension while 40% (N = 78) were at risk of hypertension. Conclusion: A substantial number of children referred for weight man-agement present with cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular impairments including impaired aerobic ftness and hypertension. Further work is required to examine factors that predict aerobic ftness and to explore whether treatment can improve cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory health outcomes.","L616802678     2017-06-20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1159/000468958,adolescent;aerobic capacity;blood pressure measurement;cardiovascular system;child;child health;consensus development;exercise test;exhaustion;female;gender;girl;heart rate;height;homeless youth;human;major clinical study;male;obesity;observational study;prehypertension;treadmill test;university hospital;Only Child;Child;Obesity,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Income measures can be insensitive to variation among the poor, do not account for variation in cost-of-living, and are subject to non-response bias and underreporting. Further, most do not include illegal income sources that may be relevant to drug-using populations. Methods: We explored the reliability and validity of an 18-item material resource scale and describe correlates of adequate resources among 1593 current, former and non-drug users recruited in New York City. Reliability was determined using coefficient alpha, omega(h), and factor analysis. Criterion validity was explored by comparing item and mean scores by income and income source using ANOVA; content validity analyses compared scores by drug use. Multiple linear regression was used to describe correlates of adequate resources. Results: The coefficient a and wh for the overall scale were 0.91 and 0.68, respectively, suggesting reliability was at least adequate. Legal income >$5000 (vs. <=$5000) and formal (vs. informal) income sources were associated with more resources, supporting criterion validity. We observed decreasing resources with increasing drug use severity, supporting construct validity. Three factors were identified: basic needs, economic resources and services. Many did not have their basic needs met and few had adequate economic resources. Correlates of adequate material resources included race/ethnicity, income, income source, and homelessness. Conclusions: The 18-item material resource scale demonstrated reliability and validity among drug users. These data provide a different view of poverty, one that details specific challenges faced by low-income communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ong, Institute for Social Research, 426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI, United States","Background: Given the rising incidence of opioid overdose in the United States, naloxone access is critical for high-risk populations, such as persons who inject drugs (PWID). Yet not all PWID have access to this life-saving antidote. With PWID in Michigan recruited via respondent driven sampling in 2017, after the 2016 standing order expanding naloxone availability through local pharmacies, we explored possible access disparities. Methods: With 46 seeds recruited from agencies serving local PWID communities, we obtained a sample of N = 410 PWID from Southeast Michigan (n = 285 form urban Detroit, and 125 for suburban/rural areas outside Detroit). Participants completed questionnaires detailing socio-demographics, health history, substance use and treatment access, including naloxone. We used multiple logistic regression to examine the predictors of self-reported naloxone access based on participant characteristics (e.g., demographics, health status) and geography (urban vs. suburban/rural). Results: Self-reported naloxone access differed significantly by location (urban = 18.3 %; suburban/rural = 41.9 %). In multivariable analyses, naloxone access was significantly associated with race, household income, employment, health insurance, recent homelessness, prescription opioid usage, Hepatitis A and C status, Hepatitis A vaccination, Hepatitis C testing, access to drug treatment and services, and hospital as the usual place of care. Conclusion: Despite recent policies to expand access, our results indicate that naloxone access among high-risk PWID is low. This warrants future research to identify effective channels to reduce barriers and increase naloxone access.","L2004049662     2019-12-04     2019-12-09 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107743,naloxone;adult;article;controlled study;demography;drug use;employment status;female;health insurance;health service;health status;hepatitis A;hepatitis C;homelessness;household income;human;injection drug user;male;Michigan;multivariate logistic regression analysis;prescription;priority journal;questionnaire;respondent driven sampling;rural area;sampling;self report;suburban area;urban area;vaccination;Naloxone;Southeastern United States,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Techniques and new diagnosis tools are important to battle this bacterial infection. There have been many advances in all those fields, but in developing countries such as Colombia, where the resources and infrastructure are limited, new fast and less expensive strategies are increasingly needed. Artificial neural networks are computational intelligence techniques that can be used in this kind of problems and offer additional support in the tuberculosis diagnosis process, providing a tool to medical staff to make decisions about management of subjects under suspicious of tuberculosis. Materials and methods: A database extracted from 105 subjects with precarious information of people under suspect of pulmonary tuberculosis was used in this study. Data extracted from sex, age, diabetes, homeless, AIDS status and a variable with clinical knowledge from the medical personnel were used. Models based on artificial neural networks were used, exploring supervised learning to detect the disease. Unsupervised learning was used to create three risk groups based on available information. Results: Obtained results are comparable with traditional techniques for detection of tuberculosis, showing advantages such as fast and low implementation costs. Sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 71% where achieved.

Although depression and social support are important in shaping the health of IDU, little is known about the relationship between these factors and overdose. Therefore, we sought to determine whether depressive symptoms and social support predicted non-fatal overdose among IDU in a Canadian setting. Methods: Data were derived from three prospective cohorts of people who use drugs: the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS), the ACCESS Cohort, and the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS). Multilevel modeling was used to determine if depression and social support were significant predictors of non-fatal overdose across time. Analyses were stratified by sex. Results: There were 1931 participants included in this analysis, including 653 (33.8%) females and 69 (3.6%) youth 20 years old or younger. Depressed men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.53, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=1.25, 1.87) and women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.23, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=1.65, 3.00) were more likely to experience a non-fatal overdose. Further, among women, those who reported having 3 or more persons they could rely upon for social support were less likely to experience a non-fatal overdose (AOR=0.54, 95% CI 0.31, 0.93). Conclusion: Although depression was a significant predictor of non-fatal drug overdose, social support was a significant predictor among women only. Possible strategies to prevent non-fatal overdose may include identifying IDU experiencing severe depressive symptoms and providing targeted mental health treatments and mobilizing interpersonal social support among IDU, especially among women.

Despite the trauma related to their placement history, young people 'aging out' are expected to adapt to adulthood at younger age and faster pace than their nonâ€care peers, who enjoy an 'extended adolescence' a far more gradual progression into adulthood than previous generations. This article draws on firstâ€person narratives of care leavers in Ireland who have aged out of care and transitioned into independent living in a dedicated social housing programme to examine their strategies for coping with these competing pressures. It examines their worries about the sudden withdrawal of supports after they reach 18 years, which they characterized as a 'care cliff'. The emotional and practical challenges they faced when transitioning to independent living at a comparatively young age are explored, and strategies for mitigating these are identified. These include better preparing care leavers for this transition, maintaining supports for longer and withdrawing them in a more gradual way, which is tailored to meet the specific needs of each care leaver and grounded in more comprehensive after care planning than has been the norm in Ireland.

E. and Stenager, E. and Stenager, E. and Chen, M.",https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L71728938&from=export,English,,"M.E. Pankiewicz-Dulacz, Psychiatric Hospital of Southern Jutland, Dept. Neurology, Hospital of Southern Jutland, Denmark","Background: Schizophrenia is associated with increased premature mortality whereas the average decrease in lifespan is 15-20 years. Excess mortality from diseases and medical conditions among persons with schizophrenia is higher, compared to other psychiatric disorders like bipolar or depression. Side effects of pharmacological treatment, unhealthy diet, as well as inadequate provision of health care have been pointed out as important possible reasons for the excess mortality from natural causes within persons with schizophrenia. The presence of medical comorbid conditions is high. Several studies show an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, obstetric complications, respiratory, endocrinologic, and metabolic disorders in schizophrenic patients. Regarding to infections, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and other infections are common and associated with substance abuse, homelessness and sexual risk behavior. Known problem among persons with schizophrenia is poor dental status, which can be source of infections and endocarditis. There are several lines of evidence that schizophrenia is associated with immune abnormalities. Abnormal blood levels of cytokines, C-reactive protein and changed immune cell functions were found among persons with schizophrenia. Furthermore schizophrenia and infectious diseases have been associated with genetic markers in the human leukocyte antigens which can give susceptibility for genetic vulnerability in these individuals. Despite these immune abnormalities and many factors that can suppress the immune system, prevalence of infectious diseases among persons with schizophrenia has not been sufficiently revealed. To contribute to the discussion about prevalence of infections in individuals with schizophrenia, we investigated the prevalence of different infections among persons with schizophrenia living in the South Jutland County. Methods: Data source and study population: We conducted a registerbased study using psychiatric hospital data from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012. This data is composed of inpatient and outpatient claims submitted by psychiatrics health care providers in the South Jutland County and includes International Classifications of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnostic for patients with schizophrenia; F20.0-F20.9 and patients with schizophrenia and substance abuse; F10.0-F.19.9. We included alcohol and substance abuse/dependence conditions as comorbidities, given the likelihood of these conditions to increase frequency of infections. Data of 694 patients with schizophrenia was linked with microbiological register MADS from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010. We conducted the analysis about prevalence of diverse infectious diseases among those patients, reasons of admitting to Infectious Disease Department, the analysis of microbiological agents which have caused infections. Results: Preliminary results: Overall, 266 women (38%) and 428 men (62%) were identified with schizophrenia. In percentages, 31% men with schizophrenia and 37% women with schizophrenia had infectious diseases. For individuals under 30 year old prevalence of infections was further increased-39%. We have found 21% schizophrenia persons with substance abuse, and 29% had infections. Skin infections, gynecological infections and cystitis were common comorbidities. Staphylococcus Aureus and Hemolytic Streptococcus occurred to be common microorganisms found in those patients. 82% of patients were admitted to the Infectious Disease Department from General Practitioners Discussion: This study is established as a 3-month pilot study with a thought of developing it to the large cohort population-based nationwide study. The strength of this study is that data on the presence or absence of infections were based on analysis of biological material. Interestingly we found that young individuals under 30 years old have been more likely to have infections compared to whole study population with prevalence of 39%. Previous studies have revealed that skin infections and urogenital infections were commo co-morbidity prior to the diagnosis of schizophrenia where our study can suggest that they are also common after diagnosis. There are many limitations. This study is designed as a observational and descriptive study with limited time of follow up on a homogeny selected population. Due to the time limitation of the study control population has not been chosen. This retrospective observational study reveals that persons with schizophrenia are often admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department and they have increased co-morbidity with skin infections gynecological infections and cystitis which is consistent with results from previously studies.","L71728938     2015-02-02 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",,leukocyte antigen;C reactive protein;cytokine;alcohol;antiinfective agent;biomaterial;schizophrenia;prevalence;infection;patient;human;pilot study;population;skin infection;diagnosis;substance abuse;gynecologic infection;cystitis;male;morbidity;diseases;mortality;female;virus hepatitis;leukocyte;Human immunodeficiency virus;immunocompetent cell;metabolic disorder;microorganism;cardiovascular disease;health care;urogenital tract infection;follow up;cell function;genetic marker;implantable cardiac monitor;premature mortality;immune system;diet;drug therapy;blood level;endocarditis;register;side effect;mental disease;risk;ICD-10;classification;health care personnel;homelessness;outpatient;hospital patient;hospital;Staphylococcus aureus;hemolytic Streptococcus;general practitioner;mental hospital;observational study;lifespan;Schizophrenia;Pilot Projects;Prevalence,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Description of policy context and objective: Ireland is currently experiencing an increase in homelessness. There is a shortage of suitable housing and this together with unaffordable rents in the private sector is pushing people out of their homes. There is an urgent need to: - focus services on homeless people and families in emergency accommodation; - accelerate the provision of social housing; - deliver more housing; - use vacant homes; and - improve the rental sector. These issues are addressed in Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness (2016-2021). The HSE support the provision of specific health aspects of the plan. The HSE, together with the Local Authorities, has joint responsibility to provide a coordinated and integrated response to delivering homeless services to this growing group. The HSE Homeless Services oversee and manage a range of services and supports. These are provided through outreach specialist services, and specialised teams and individuals. They are contracted through the voluntary sector, to deliver services on behalf of the HSE to service users from diverse groups. Targeted population: Homeless population and others that the mainstream services don't reach. Highlights: (innovation, Impact and outcomes) This innovative model of service policy planning and practice sees operations as an integrated system brought together by a common aim ; to provide access to services to vulnerable populations that mainstream services do not reach. The model operates within the policy and structural framework of the HSE's National Drug Rehabilitation Framework for health care provision. Within this framework Safetynet Primary Care (a medical charity) provides three levels of care i) Open access drop- in clinics for homeless people and others ineligible for mainstream services or unable to attend them. Typically these sites are appended to NGO non-medical low threshold services with high service user engagement (needle exchange, drop in food hall etc) ii) In-Reach Primary Care teams - at this level service provision takes medical care to the emergency hostels following best practice for health care for this cohort iii) An outreach service operates via mobile health unit targets the most vulnerable of the target group ie those without accommodation (rough sleepers). Each level of service is provided by a mix of statutory non statutory and private organisations with Safetynet coordinating patient care via a web based patient management system ensuring that wherever patients are seen their medical records are available to the medical professional treating them. The integrated model however extends beyond the Primarycare domain to secondary care where a Social Inclusion team has been established in one of the cities Acute hospital. Coordination of patient care at the interface between primary and secondary care is managed through Multi disciplinary team working accross the two domains. An Innovative Partnership for Health Equity exists between researchers policy makers and planers and education has meant action research has been implemented to determine the homeless population's health needs and service utilisation. This research has enabled policy, programme design to be finely attuned to need. This research has shown the increased development of services overtime of access to health care and access to key working and case management for the homeless population in Dublin. Comments on transferability: This approach is adaptable to other urban centres in Ireland and Internationally. It also demonstrate that this level of interagency working is possible and can extend to other marginalised groups with complex needs suffering from inequalities such as refugees, travellers and migrants. Conclusions: (comprising key findings, discussion and lesso s learned) The layered Safetynet system of provision for people falling through the service gaps for hard to reach groups is enhanced by Partnerships that demand reform in order to ensure health equity is reality rather than rhetoric.

Patel, Department of Veterans Affairs, Los Angeles, CA, United States","Aims: Homeless veterans have high rates of medical, mental health, and substance use co-morbidities, and emergency department (ED) and inpatient service utilization. In 2013, VA established a homeless-oriented patient centered medical home national demonstration program, referred to as the Homeless Patient Aligned Care Team (HPACT). Unlike traditional PCMH models, the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center (WLA) HPACT employed a series of complex primary care management interventions tailored to homeless Veterans seeking care in the ED for low-acuity problems. Methods: Development of the WLA HPACT was carried out in three phases - literature review, diagnosis, and implementation. In phase 1, we conducted a literature review of the factors contributing to homeless Veteran ED utilization patterns. In the diagnosis phase, we undertook a local needs assessment (conducted by informal stakeholder focus groups) to determine the organizational context for the WLA HPACT program and how to best evaluate HPACT's objective to reduce ED utilization rates for HPACT patients. The implementation phase employed a mixed-method progress focused formative evaluation to examine patient characteristics, intervention processes, ED utilization patterns, staff perceptions and interventions to decrease ED visits. Results: Findings suggest high prevalence of patients with substance abuse needs (73%), increased engagement in substance abuse treatment programs after being enrolled in the HPACT program for 6 months (26%), and reduction in ED visits at 6 months (mean reduction 3.2 visits). Conclusions: The findings of this QI effort inform clinical and organization processes for the WLA HPACT that should be considered for on-going implementation. Recommendations for future implementation include complex care management interventions for patients with pain needs, substance abuse conditions, as well as modifications to organizational features of the program such as hours of operations, and substance use/mental health team composition.","L71802081     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.543,total quality management;veteran;human;college;drug dependence;patient;substance abuse;diagnosis;hospital patient;morbidity;prevalence;emergency ward;pain;health;needs assessment;substance use;primary medical care;mental health;United States;information processing;model,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Box 356340, Seattle, WA, United States","Background: Office-based buprenorphine treatment is effective for opioid use disorder. Scant research has examined programmatic factors impacting successful initiation of treatment. To increase initiation of eligible patients, our buprenorphine program implemented changes to lower treatment thresholds. Most notable among these was elimination of a requirement that patients demonstrate abstinence from stimulants prior to initiating buprenorphine. Methods: This observational, retrospective study included patients screened for primary care-based buprenorphine treatment under high- and low-threshold conditions from 2015 to 2017. Background characteristics and treatment data were extracted from the electronic medical record and clinical registry. Chi-squared tests were used to compare proportions of patients initiated within 90 days of screening and retained to 60 days after initiation, under both conditions. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to compare relative odds of buprenorphine initiation after adjustment for several covariates. All analyses were stratified by recent stimulant use. Results: The sample of 168 patients included 96 in the high-threshold group and 72 in the low-threshold group. Among patients with recent stimulant use, low-threshold conditions were associated with a higher proportion of patients initiated (69% versus 35%, p = 0.002) and higher relative odds of initiation (aOR = 7.01, 95% CI = 2.26â€“21.80) but also with a lower proportion of patients retained (63% versus 100%, p = 0.004). Among patients without recent stimulant use, low-threshold conditions did not change these measures by a statistically significant margin. Conclusions: Lower-threshold policies may increase buprenorphine treatment initiation for patients with co-occurring stimulant use. However, patients using stimulants may require additional supports to remain engaged.","L2001968048     2019-05-21     2019-05-28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.03.009,buprenorphine;methadone;adult;age;amphetamine dependence;article;cocaine dependence;controlled study;female;heroin dependence;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;mass fragmentography;methamphetamine dependence;observational study;prescription;primary medical care;priority journal;retrospective study;threshold limit value;time to treatment;treatment outcome;urinalysis;Buprenorphine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Design Qualitative study using peer research. Setting North East of England. Participants Three focus group discussions were held involving (1) people with lived experience of multiple and complex needs (n=5); (2) front-line staff from health, social care and voluntary organisations that support multiple and complex needs groups (n=7); and (3) managers and commissioners of these organisations (n=9). Results Findings from this study provide valuable perspectives of people with multiple complex needs and those that provide them with support on what may be perceived factors underlying premature mortality. Mental ill health and substance misuse (often co-occurring dual diagnosis) were perceived as influencing premature mortality among multiple and complex needs groups. Perceptions of opportunities to identify people at risk included critical life events (eg, bereavement, relationship breakdown) and transitions (eg, release from prison, completion of drug treatment). Early prevention, particularly supporting young people experiencing adverse childhood experiences, was also highlighted as a priority. Conclusion High mortality in multiple and complex needs groups may be reduced by addressing dual diagnosis, providing more support at critical life events and investing in early prevention efforts. Future interventions could take into consideration the intricate nature of multiple and complex needs and improve service access and navigation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 2 Total Times Cited: 2 Cited Reference Count: 34 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044634,preventive medicine;public health;qualitative research;HOMELESSNESS;PRISONERS,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

We aim to explore citizens' opinions about homelessness and to explain the differences in attitudes within the general population of eight European countries: France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. METHODS: A nationally representative telephone survey of European citizens was conducted in 2017. Three domains were investigated: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices about homelessness. Based on a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), a generalized linear model for clustered and weighted samples was used to probe the associations between groups with opposing attitudes. RESULTS: Response rates ranged from 30.4% to 33.5% (N = 5,295). Most respondents (57%) had poor knowledge about homelessness. Respondents who thought the government spent too much on homelessness, people who are homeless should be responsible for housing, people remain homeless by choice, or homelessness keeps capabilities/empowerment intact (regarding meals, family contact, and access to work) clustered together (negative attitudes, 30%). Respondents who were willing to pay taxes, welcomed a shelter, or acknowledged people who are homeless may lack some capabilities (i.e. agreed on discrimination in hiring) made another cluster (positive attitudes, 58%). Respondents living in semi-urban or urban areas (ORs 1.33 and 1.34) and those engaged in practices to support people who are homeless (ORs > 1.4; p<0.005) were more likely to report positive attitudes, whereas those from France and Poland (p<0.001) were less likely to report positive attitudes. CONCLUSION: The majority of European citizens hold positive attitudes towards people who are homeless, however there remain significant differences between and within countries. Although it is clear that there is strong support for increased government action and more effective solutions for Europe's growing homelessness crisis, there also remain public opinion barriers rooted in enduring negative perceptions.","1932-6203     Petit, Junie     Loubiere, Sandrine     Orcid: 0000-0001-6715-1223     Tinland, Aurlie     Vargas-Moniz, Maria     Spinnewijn, Freek     Manning, Rachel     Orcid: 0000-0003-2254-1484     Santinello, Massimo     Wolf, Judith     Bokszczanin, Anna     Bernad, Roberto     Kallmen, Hakan     Ornelas, Jose     Auquier, Pascal     HOME-EU consortium study group     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     United States     PLoS One. 2019 Sep 25;14(9):e0221896. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0221896. eCollection 2019. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0221896,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Europe;Female;Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;*Homeless Persons;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Multivariate Analysis;*Public Opinion;Surveys and Questionnaires;Young Adult",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

For those with mental disorders, interventions are centered on achieving mental health and drug rehabilitation alongside housing readiness, often to the detriment of access to housing. Notwithstanding, more European countries are investing in a new model, Housing First (HF), which postulates immediate access to permanent housing with no initial requirements for treatment. While results of the European HF programs are published on individual-level data, little is known about the opinions of the general population about homelessness and the societal value of the HF model, which can represent barriers to the model's dissemination. Therefore, we present the protocol of a study designed for the following objectives: 1) to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) about homelessness within the general population of 8 European countries, 2) to assess the valuation of the HF model by European citizens, and 3) to estimate the lifetime prevalence of homelessness in the targeted countries. METHODS: A telephone survey was conducted from March to December 2017 among adults selected from opt-in panels from France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Poland, and Sweden. A total sample of 5600 interviews was expected, with 700 per country. The interviews included three sections: first, the KAP about homelessness; second, the valuation of the HF model by measuring a respondent's willingness-to-pay (WTP) through the contingent valuation method; and third, an assessment of the lifetime prevalence of homelessness among the general population. Descriptive analyses and comparisons between countries will be conducted. KAP indicators will be created and their psychometric properties assessed. Determinants of WTP will be assessed through regression models. DISCUSSION: This survey will highlight Europeans' views of homelessness, especially their level of tolerance towards homelessness, potential misconceptions and the most important barriers for the implementation of the HF model. Additionally, the results on the valuation of the HF model by citizens could be instrumental for key stakeholders in understanding the level of support from the general population.

Most meals were provided by multi-service agencies, but like emergency programs, these agencies were heavily dependent on donations and they were more likely than emergency programs to report constraints and service interruptions because demands exceeded available supplies.

This study sought to examine OAT retention and discontinuation among AYA. Methods: Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort of street-involved AYA in Vancouver, Canada, between September 2005 and December 2018. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was employed to identify sociodemographic, substance use, and other factors associated with time to first OAT. Substance use, homelessness, service utilization, and criminal justice patterns among AYA who did and did not initiate OAT were examined using before and after analysis. Results: Of 676 AYA who reported weekly illicit opioid use, 454 (67.2%) reported not being on OAT at some point over the study period and 217 (32.1%) initiated OAT over follow-up. In non-linear growth curve analysis, only participants retained in OAT demonstrated significant reductions in daily illicit opioid use when compared to â€˜no OATâ€™ controls (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, reductions in homelessness (p = 0.070) and increases in difficulty accessing services (p = 0.078) were observed between participants retained in OAT vs. â€˜no OATâ€™ controls, while reductions in homelessness (p = 0.085) and weekly non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) (p = 0.061) were observed between â€˜OAT discontinuersâ€™ vs. â€˜no OATâ€™ controls. Conclusions: Despite finding that OAT retention was associated with significant reductions in daily illicit opioid use, no significant improvements in other key indicators were observed. This underscores the importance of providing supports alongside OAT to improve treatment outcomes among AYA.","L2017660902     2022-04-20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109441,adult;article;Canada;cohort analysis;controlled study;criminal justice;demography;drug therapy;female;follow up;growth curve;homelessness;human;human experiment;juvenile;longitudinal study;male;outcome assessment;prescription;prospective study;substance use;young adult;opiate;opiate agonist;Adolescent,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This shift in age distribution among people experiencing homelessness has challenged our long-held views of the causes of homelessness. Age-related neurological diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases of the brain (NDDB), may play a role eliciting homelessness in a significant proportion of vulnerable older adults. This article aims to explore relationships between homelessness and NDDB in a cohort of research participants enrolled in observational studies on NDDB at an academic center. Methods: We reviewed charts of the Memory and Aging Center (MAC) of the University of California, San Francisco's database searching for research participants with NDDB that had direct relationship to homelessness. We reviewed all research visits conducted between 2004 and 2018 (N = 5,300). Research participants who had any relationship to homelessness were included in this analysis. NDDB was diagnosed via comprehensive neurological, functional, neuropsychological, and biomarker assessments. Non-parametric tests were used for analysis. Thirteen participants were found to have a direct relationship with homelessness. Seven were female and the median of education was 16 (IR: 12.0-19.5) years. Participants were divided into two groups: Those who experienced homelessness while symptomatic from a NDDB but before formal diagnosis (n = 5, Group 1); and participants with formally diagnosed NDDB who exhibited a new propensity toward homelessness (n = 8, Group 2). Compared to Group 2, participants in Group 1 were younger (p = 0.021) and showed similar results in the neuropsychological evaluation. In both groups, the most prevalent diagnosis was frontotemporal dementia. In Group 1, the majority of participants became homeless in the setting of a fragile socioeconomic situation and informants believed that NDDB contributed or caused their homeless state. In Group 2, a new propensity toward homelessness became manifest in different ways and it stood out that all of these participants were well-supported by family and friends during their illness. Conclusions and Relevance: This case series highlights the role that NDDB may have in precipitating homelessness among vulnerable older adults, particularly in the setting of challenging socioeconomic circumstances and unsupportive living environments. Social ramifications of these findings, particularly pertaining to challenges around rehousing these individuals is discussed.","1664-2295     PiÃ±a-Escudero, Stefanie Danielle     LÃ³pez, LucÃ­a     Sriram, Sandeepa     Longoria Ibarrola, Erika Mariana     Miller, Bruce     Lanata, Serggio     P01 AG019724/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States     P30 AG062422/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States     P50 AG023501/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States     T32 AG023481/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States     Journal Article     Switzerland     Front Neurol. 2021 Jan 13;11:562218. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2020.562218. eCollection 2020. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fneur.2020.562218,Alzheimer disease;dementia;frontotemporal dementia;homeless persons;homelessness;neurodegenerative diseases;social determinants of health;underserved populations;commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential;conflict of interest.;Neurodegenerative Diseases,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

The introductory section establishes the framework for the paper, providing an overview of homelessness and the homemaking literature. Strengths in the homemaking approach are identified, which reconceptualises homelessness as a human-centered phenomenon that can be understood as 'resistance' to societies that block accesses to mainstream housing for people who are (also) socially and economically marginalised. Homemaking moves beyond mainstream academic analyses which explore homelessness in terms of 'sin' (addiction and criminality), 'sickness' (poor health, especially poor mental health) and 'systems' (housing market failure and inadequate social protection and public health systems). The paper argues that, while important in refreshing our thinking about homelessness by offering a new, radical epistemology of housing, homemaking is limited by not contextualising the dwelling practices it seeks to explain, particularly in respect of how it defines 'homelessness' and also risks misinterpreting transitory behavioural adaptations as something deeper.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1080/02673037.2021.1929859,Homelessness;agency;choice;homemaking;CLUSTER-ANALYSIS;MENTAL-ILLNESS;SHELTER USE;DEFINITIONS;TYPOLOGY;PATHWAYS;POLITICS;PEOPLE,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Specific aims included: (1) Examine how alcohol, drug and psychiatric problems differ by housing status prior to entering SLHs. (2) Examine changes in housing status of SLH residents at 6, 12, and 18 month follow-up. (3) Assess how housing status and psychiatric problems are related to substance use at follow-up. Methods: Study participants (N= 299) were recruited from two organizations operating SLHs. Four houses were associated with an outpatient treatment program and 20 houses were freestanding houses unaffiliated with treatment. Participants needed to be age 18 or older and able to provide informed consent. Participants were interviewed within their first week of entering SLHs and again at 6-, 12-, and 18-months. Study measures included demographics, housing status, the ASI, the Brief Symptom Inventory, peak density (a measure of substance use), and DSM IV Checklist for alcohol and drug dependence. Results: Between entry into the SLHs and 18-month follow-up homelessness fell from 16% to 4%. Persons who were in marginal housing situations fell from 66% to 46%, while stable housing grew from 13% to 27%. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models showed participants living in SLHs or in stable community housing (e.g., apartment or house) had significantly better outcomes on all alcohol and drug measures compared to those that were marginally housed or homeless. Psychiatric distress declined over time, but higher distress was associated with increased drug problems. Conclusions: Results support the role of SLHs as an important resource for persons with substance use disorders who are homeless or lack stable housing. Residence in SLHs is associated with improvements in housing status and psychiatric distress, both of which are associated with drug and alcohol outcomes.","L618520667     2017-10-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.460,alcohol;adult;Brief Symptom Inventory;checklist;distress syndrome;drug abuse;drug dependence;DSM-IV;female;follow up;homelessness;housing;human;informed consent;major clinical study;male;organization;outpatient;resident;young adult,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Describe demographic characteristics, HIV risk factors, and past 12-month drug and alcohol dependence among probationers and parolees entering sober living houses (SLHs). 2. Assess the extent to which unstable housing prior to entering the SLH and other factors predicts HIV risk. 3. Assess rates of HIV testing over the past 6 months. Methods: Using data from an ongoing study of SLHs for parolees and probationers in Los Angeles, we examined HIV risk among 108 participants within the first month of entering a SLH. Study instruments included a measure of demo- graphic characteristics, the DSM-IV checklist for alcohol and drug dependence, and the Risk Assessment Battery for HIV. Logistic regression was used to predict HIV risk. Results: Sample characteristics included 76% male, 39% white, 28% African- American, and 19% Hispanic. Twenty percent was selfidentified as LGBT. The most common drug dependencies were methamphetamine (58%) and alcohol (37%). HIV risk behaviors during the 6 months prior to the interview were high: 23% reported injection drug use, 17% shared needles, 32% had sex with 2 or more partners and 47% of those having sex never used condoms. However, only 61% had been tested for HIV during the past 6 months. Unstable housing prior to entering the SLH was a significant predictor of injection drug use (OR = 3.2, CI = 1.3-8.1, p < .05), number of sexual partners (OR = 2.8, CI = 1.3-5.9, p < .01) and trading or buying sex for drugs (OR = 2.9, CI = 1.1-7.9, p < .05). Other predictors of risk included 6-month measures of alcohol and drug use. Conclusions: Results highlight the need for increased HIV testing for parolees and probationers entering sober living recovery houses. Findings also document the important role of stable housing for preventing HIV risk among this population. Expanding the availability of SLHs for ex-offenders could play an important role in meeting thee housing needs. Future analyses will examine changes in risk behaviors and HIV testing over 12 months.","L72176862     2016-02-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.07.486,alcohol;methamphetamine;risk;human;offender;drug abuse;college;drug dependence;Human immunodeficiency virus;housing;HIV test;drug use;injection;United States;African American;demography;logistic regression analysis;risk assessment;alcoholism;Hispanic;population;sexuality;condom;needle;checklist;interview;male;risk factor,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Patients were chosen randomly from the selection on-hold at the Healthcare Record's office. The tool consisted of 15 statements taken from the National Consent Policy (HSE, 2013). Each statement is a specific requirement for correct and legal consent to be established. Results: This audit result highlighted the quality of the consent documentation and process in TSCUH. There was record of obtained/refused consent with dates were present in the patient healthcare record was 98.3%. Consent documentation clearly identified service user by name (98.3%), Date of Birth (95%), Home address (88.5%), with healthcare identification number (95%).

Providing mental health care for these groups represents a particular challenge, and evidence on good practice is required. This study explored the experiences and views of experts in 14 European countries regarding mental health care for six socially marginalised groups: long-term unemployed; street sex workers; homeless; refugees/asylum seekers; irregular migrants and members of the travelling communities. Methods: Two highly deprived areas were selected in the capital cities of 14 countries, and experts were interviewed for each of the six marginalised groups. Semi-structured interviews with case vignettes were conducted to explore experiences of good practice and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: In a total of 154 interviews, four components of good practice were identified across all six groups: a) establishing outreach programmes to identify and engage with individuals with mental disorders; b) facilitating access to services that provide different aspects of health care, including mental health care, and thus reducing the need for further referrals; c) strengthening the collaboration and co-ordination between different services; and d) disseminating information on services both to marginalised groups and to practitioners in the area. Conclusions: Experts across Europe hold similar views on what constitutes good practice in mental health care for marginalised groups.

All cities had group-specific services for the homeless, street sex workers and asylum seekers/refugees. Generic services provided more health-care programmes. Group-specific services provided more outreach programmes and social care. There was a substantial overlap in the programmes provided by the two types of services. Conclusions: In deprived areas of European capitals, a considerable number of services provide mental health care to socially marginalized groups. Access to these services often remains difficult. Group-specific services have been widely established, but their role overlaps with that of generic services. More research and conceptual clarity on the function of group-specific services are required.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 28 Total Times Cited: 28 Cited Reference Count: 29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Access (Mental Health)",10.1093/eurpub/ckr214,WESTERN COUNTRIES;PREVALENCE;HOMELESS;Europe;Mental Health,,,Y,N,Included

Quinn, Department of Paediatric Laboratory Medicine, Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, Dublin 1, Ireland","INTRODUCTION Assay interference is an unfortunate but frequent occurrence in routine Biochemistry investigations. Typically a patient's clinical history and accompanying biochemical investigations can help identify a potentially inappropriate result. However, where a result fits the clinical context of a patient, it is possible to overlook the presence of assay interference. We describe a case of interference with plasma creatinine measurement in a patient following methanol ingestion. CaSe PReSeNTaTION A 5 year old girl presented to a regional Hospital emergency department following methanol ingestion. A family member had been making a model car and had left the solution unattended. On presentation the patient complained of a sore throat but was otherwise clinically well. Initial blood gas analysis performed locally showed an elevated anion gap and IV fluids were administered. The patient was transferred to Temple Street Children's University Hospital (TSCUH) for treatment with fomepizole. Laboratory investigations at TSCUH demonstrated an elevated plasma creatinine using a Jaffe method, mimicking acute kidney injury. Further investigation found that analysis of the same sample using an enzymatic method on Roche platform gave a plasma creatinine within the normal reference range. After consultation with Toxbase it was noted that model engine fuels that contain methanol may also contain nitromethane which has been shown to interfere with the measurement of plasma creatinine through the Jaffe (alkaline picrate) reaction. Nitromethane is highly lipid soluble and subsequent analysis of plasma creatinine samples by the Jaffe method showed a slow decrease in levels which may reflect its relatively long elimination period. CONCLUSION This is the first case identified in Temple Street Children's Hospital that demonstrated an interference with the Jaffe creatinine method in a patient with accidental methanol ingestion. Nitromethane should be included in each laboratory's list of substances that interfere with the Jaffe reaction.","L629411057     2019-09-30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",,4 methylpyrazole;methanol;nitromethane;acute kidney failure;anion gap;blood gas analysis;case report;child;clinical article;conference abstract;consultation;creatinine blood level;drug overdose;drug therapy;emergency ward;enzyme chemistry;female;homeless youth;human;human tissue;ingestion;lipid solubility;male;preschool child;sore throat;university hospital;Methanol;Creatinine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Raftery, Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, Dublin, Ireland","Background: Vascular access is required for haemodialysis (HD), a form of renal replacement therapy required when a child has acute or end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Central venous catheter (CVC) line infections are the second most common cause of vascular access loss in the long term HD patient, commonly caused by poor hand hygiene practices, clinical environment or inadequate sterilisation procedures. In the literature the reported rates of infection range from 0.8-4.8 episodes/1000 catheter days in this patient group. Aim: To audit CVC line related infection rates in our tertiary HD unit in Temple Street Children's University Hospital (TSCUH) over a 5 year period. Methods: A retrospective review was carried out on all patients who had HD from January 2012- January 2017 (inclusive) using a CVC. Results/Findings 34 patients required HD, of which 44% were female and 56% male. Twenty-three patients (68%) were aged between 5-10 years of age. Dysplastic kidneys was the most common reason for requiring HD (n=9, 26.2%). Eight patients required HD for 1-6 months, 5 patients for 6-12 months, 19 patients for 12-48 months, and 2 patients for >60 months. Five out of 34 children developed CVC line infections with an overall infection rate of 0.22 episodes per 1000 catheter days. Loss of protective caps was the main reason for infection (n=3). Staph-aureous, pseudomonas oryzihabitans, enterococcus faecalis and mixed coagulase negative staphylococci were the identified organisms causing infection. Conclusions: CVC line infections in long-term HD patients attending TSCUH are maintained at a low rate in comparison to published data. Strict application of Aseptic Non Touch Technique shows favourable results without the need for prophylactic antibiotics locks. Future work includes a cost benefit analysis of this practice.","L628681302     2019-08-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/archdischild-2019-epa.514,antibiotic agent;central venous catheter;child;clinical article;coagulase negative Staphylococcus;cohort analysis;conference abstract;cost benefit analysis;end stage renal disease;Enterococcus faecalis;female;hemodialysis patient;homeless youth;human;infant;infection rate;male;nonhuman;pediatric hospital;preschool child;Pseudomonas;retrospective study;school child;touch;university hospital;vascular access,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

The purpose of this two-center study is to describe the impact of targeted biopsies on altering pharmacological management in this patient group. Specific Aims: This research aims to identify the demographics of pediatric renal transplant patients from 2007 to 2017 and treatment changes in response to post-transplant renal biopsies. Study Methods: A retrospective review of 103 patients who received a renal transplant from 2007 to 2017 was analyzed. Patients who underwent at least one renal biopsy at Temple Street Children's University Hospital or Our Lady Children's Hospital, Crumlin, were included. Data collected include: demographic data, clinical indications, biopsy and histological findings. Data was analyzed via Microsoft Excel 2016. Results: Of 103 renal transplant patients, 26 (24%) had one or more biopsies (n = 49). The male:female ratio was 1.77:1 with a mean age of 9.64 years. Within the first year, 43% of biopsies were performed. Biopsy indications were raised creatinine Â± proteinuria. Increased immunosuppression (n = 20), reduced calcineurin inhibitor (n = 5), IV immunoglobulin use (n = 5), antibiotic change (n = 2), and no change (n = 17) occurred due to biopsy results. No major complications were seen. Conclusions: Targeted transplant renal biopsies are valuable. A negative result for rejection is as valuable as a positive result in modulating treatment. Using biopsy findings in the 24% of transplant patients with indications potentially reduces the risks of over-immunosuppression and secondary complications, whilst ensuring those needing enhanced therapy receive it. A long-term study of outcomes comparing centres using targeted versus protocol biopsies is recommended.","L627772641     2019-05-28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1111/petr.13404,antibiotic agent;calcineurin inhibitor;creatinine;human immunoglobulin;child;complication;conference abstract;controlled study;demography;female;histopathology;homeless youth;human;immunosuppressive treatment;Ireland;kidney biopsy;kidney graft;major clinical study;male;null result;proteinuria;retrospective study;school child;software;surgery;university hospital;Kidney Transplantation;Biopsy,,,N,N,Full text screen

Ragonnet-Cronin, Univ of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Background: Harm reduction interventions have dramatically reduced HIV incidence among people who inject drugs (PWID). In Glasgow, <10 infections/year have been diagnosed since the mid-90s. However in 2015 a sharp rise in HIV diagnoses was noted among PWID: all were subtype C with two identical drug resistant mutations and some displayed low avidity, suggesting the infections were linked and recently acquired. The outbreak follows reports of recent PWID outbreaks in Greece, Romania, Ireland, and the USA. Methods: We collected pol sequences from all subtype C HIV diagnoses from Glasgow since 2010 (n=228). In parallel, we obtained sequences from the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database (UKRDB) which contains sequences from all UK patients diagnosed until 2013. We blasted the Glasgow sequences against the UKRDB and the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) database and selected the ten closest matches from either database to each Glasgow sequence. A maximum likelihood phylogeny was reconstructed comprising 228 Glasgow sequences, 762 UKRDB and 1144 LANL. The outbreak cluster was identified and extracted from the tree and time-resolved in BEAST. Results: A tight cluster of 105 sequences stood out in the ML phylogeny. All sequences originated from Glasgow and contained E138A and V179E. Mean genetic distance was <1% with multiple sets of identical sequences from different patients. Short branches in the BEAST phylogeny indicated rapid transmission (Figure 1). The outbreak subdivided into three subclusters, two of which displayed rapid and recent transmission events. The common ancestor of the outbreak dated back to 2004 and the oldest sequence represented a female PWID diagnosed in 2005. Five patients were diagnosed in 2008-2009 and all others between 2010 and 2016. We extracted node dates to estimate the timing of transmissions, demonstrating an acceleration of the transmission rate through time, culminating between 2013 and 2015 when 63 transmissions took place. All patients reported injecting drugs, and the majority were men (59/94, 63%), suggesting that infections have been transmitted primarily through injection rather than sexually. While disclosure of needle sharing was variable, the majority (88/90, 98%) were co-infected with Hepatitis C. Conclusion: The strain is limited to Glasgow but transmission is ongoing. We are currently investigating associations between the outbreak and epidemiological parameters including homelessness.","L616686160     2017-06-13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",,acceleration;clinical trial;data base;diagnosis;female;genetic distance;Greece;hepatitis C;homelessness;human;Human immunodeficiency virus;injection;Ireland;major clinical study;male;maximum likelihood method;needle sharing;nonhuman;phylogeny;Romania;Scotland;Disease Outbreaks,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

ACCES Team,Dublin 8,Ireland.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of mental illness among the residents of a homeless hostel in inner city Dublin. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among hostel residents, as previous studies have indicated that homeless hostel-dwelling men in Dublin constitute the largest single grouping of homeless Irish people. All agreeable residents were interviewed by the authors over an eight-week period using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) Clinical Version. For each disorder, the current (30-day) and past prevalence was determined. RESULTS: A total of 38 residents were interviewed, resulting in a response rate of 39.2% for the study. A total of 81.6% of residents had a current Axis I diagnosis; this number increased to 89.5% when combining current and past diagnoses. Only four residents had no diagnosis. There was considerable comorbidity between disorders, with a significant number of residents experiencing both mental illness and substance use problems. When considering lifetime diagnoses, 31.6% had a single diagnosis only; 57.9% had two/more diagnoses. Twelve residents (31.6%) had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital during their lifetime. The most prevalent disorders during the past month were Alcohol Dependence (23.7%), Opioid Dependence and Major Depressive Disorder (both 18.4%), Opioid Abuse and Alcohol-Induced Depression (both 7.9%). Only 23.7% of interviewed residents were attending psychiatric or addiction services. A significant number of residents who did not wish to participate in the study were identified by hostel staff as having a confirmed psychiatric diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The survey demonstrated a very high prevalence of mental disorders among homeless hostel residents. The high prevalence of dual diagnosis highlights the need for greater collaboration between psychiatric services and addiction services. The outcome also points to the importance of providing mental health training to emergency shelter/hostel staff. Research into the mental health status of the homeless should be undertaken regularly if services are to be planned to meet the needs of this vulnerable group.","2051-6967     Prinsloo, Bernice     Parr, Catherine     Fenton, Joanne     Journal Article     England     Ir J Psychol Med. 2012 Jan;29(1):22-26. doi: 10.1017/S0790966700017560. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Mental health condition",10.1017/s0790966700017560,Cross-Sectional Studies;Mentally Ill Persons;Prevalence,,,Y,N,Included

Ravikumar, Health Promotion Research Centre, School of Health Sciences, NUI Galway, Ireland","INTRODUCTION: The increasing availability of cheap, energy-dense and nutrient poor food has resulted in a change in the status of the homeless population from primarily underweight to obese, with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other metabolic factors. This has resulted in the hunger-obesity or food-security obesity paradox which refers to a chronic state of both obesity and hunger. Food insecurity has been associated with an increased risk of acute hospital and emergency services. Financial barriers and difficulty accessing cooking facilities are major obstacles to healthy dietary practices, with diets dominated by takeaway and convenience foods. Limited research is available on diet specific to the homeless population and this study set out to explore dietary practices, barriers to consuming healthy food and wellbeing among this population group. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were utilised in this study. The study sample included service users that were homeless in Galway and availing of sheltered and emergency accommodation or sleeping rough. Healthcare and social service providers working with members of the homeless population in Galway were also recruited for this study. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and NVivo was used to manage the data. RESULTS: A cohort of 12 service users (9 men and 3 women) and 5 service providers (3 men and 2 women) were recruited through Galway homeless services (n = 17). The data analysis process yielded the following themes from service user interviews: (1) loss of control over diet, (2) not eating well, (3) impact on physical and emotional wellbeing, (4) daily obstacles to eating well, (5) meeting basic dietary needs. The data analysis process yielded the following themes from service provider interviews: (1) food choice varies by service, (2) food skills, (3) lack of control over diet, (4) daily obstacles to eating well, (5) poor physical and emotional wellbeing. The findings highlighted a high prevalence of fast food, takeaway and convenience food and a low intake of vegetables within the homeless population. Poor diet was linked to increased weight and alterations in lipid profile and blood sugars. Food insecurity was linked to depressive symptoms and stress. CONCLUSION: High energy, low nutrient density foods are frequently consumed within this population. These data highlight the impact of food insecurity on physical and emotional wellbeing in the homeless population. In order to address diet-related health disparities, health promotion initiatives should be targeted at building healthy public policy in relation to diet and nutrition and developing food skills with members of this population and service providers.","L633901692     2021-01-18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Conference Abstract,Nutrition and Healthy Eating",10.1111/obr.13118,adult;body weight;clinical article;cohort analysis;conference abstract;controlled study;convenience food;cooking;data analysis;depression;eating;fast food;female;food insecurity;food security;glucose blood level;habit;health disparity;health promotion;human;lipid fingerprinting;male;nutrient;nutrition;population group;prevalence;public policy;semi structured interview;skill;sleep;social work;physiological stress;takeaway (food);thematic analysis;vegetable;wellbeing;Food Habits,,,Y,N,Included

Reif, Institute for Behavioral Health, Heller School, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, United States","Aims: Innovative ways are needed to improve the quality of treatment for drug use disorders. Performance-based contracting (PBC) aims to align program incentives and purchaser goals, yet is uncommonin drug abuse treatment systems. In 2007, Maine implemented a second-generation PBC system with financial incentives, for outpatient programs, addressing problems identified with its previous PBC. This study aims to (1) determine whether rewarded measures and outcomes changed under the PBC, (2) examine whether there was client selection due to the PBC and (3) explore possible unintended effects of the PBC. Methods: We use state administrative data from 2005 to 2011 and multilevel modeling techniques with a difference-in-difference approach, and a non-PBC comparison group, to determine whether the 2007 PBC resulted in improved access and retention in treatment and whether positive or negative unintended effects stemmed from it. Results: Preliminary analyses (N= 25,105 admissions) indicated that the probability of receiving four or more outpatient treatment sessions did not change significantly between the 2005-2007 preperiod and the 2008-2011 post-period (OR .9, p = .16) and was not significantly different in the PBC agencies from the non-PBC agencies. Similarly there was no significant change in the probability of remaining in treatment for 90 days or more. The most significant predictors of retention were client characteristics (previous treatment, criminal justice involvement and homelessness). Client selection problems were not identified in an analysis of admission rates for individuals with diagnosed mental disorders. Wecontinue to refine these models and examine the impact of the PBC on other factors and client outcomes. Conclusions: Introduction of a PBC is a significant change in payment design that may affect how drug treatment services are delivered, thus increasing our understanding of its effects is critical. In preliminary analyses we find the overall net effect of incentivized contract very small and not significant.","L71802121     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.583,addiction;college;drug dependence;human;outpatient;diseases;multilevel analysis;drug dependence treatment;drug use;United States;mental disease;criminal justice;homelessness;model;drug therapy;Motivation,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Results: Of 394 males, 35 (8.9%) sold sex to men and 66 (16.8%) sold sex to women. Correlates of selling sex to men included bisexual/gay identity (aOR: 31.0; 95% CI: 8.1, 119.1), Bronx residence (vs. Manhattan) (aOR: 38.1; 95% CI: 6.2, 235.5), and in the past 12 months, being homeless (aOR: 9.9; 95% CI: 2.0, 49.6), â‰¥3 sex partners (aOR: 26.2; 95% CI: 4.7, 147.6), non-injection cocaine use (aOR: 5.4; 95% CI: 1.6, 18.2), and injecting methamphetamine (aOR: 36.9; 95% CI: 5.7, 240.0). Correlates of selling sex to women included, in the past 12 months, â‰¥3 sex partners (aOR: 14.6; 95% CI: 6.6, 31.9), binge drinking at least once a week (aOR: 3.1; 95% CI: 1.6, 6.1), non-injection crack use (aOR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.6, 6.7), most frequently injected ""speedball"" (vs. heroin) (aOR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.2), and receptively shared syringes (aOR: 2.4; 95%CI: 1.2, 4.8). Conclusions: Among male IDUs, those who sold sex had more sex partners, which may facilitate the sexual spread of HIV among IDUs and to non-IDU male and female sex partners. HIV prevention interventions aimed at male IDUs who sell sex should consider both their sexual and parenteral risks and the greater risk of engaging in exchange sex associated with the use of injection and non-injection stimulant drugs.

Method The data for this investigation were collected from a prospective cohort study of patients who completed detoxification in Ireland (N = 142). After baseline, participants completed follow-up visits at three, six and nine months. Cox regression models were used to analyze the association between measures of hope and time to relapse. Results Of the 142 participants included in this study, 43 (30.3%) were female and the mean duration of substance use was 14.3 years (standard deviation: 5.8). In the multivariable analysis, a five-unit increase in mean Trait Hope Scale scores was associated with a mean decrease of 23% in the Hazard Ratio (HR) of relapse following detoxification (HR = 0.77, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.63-0.94; p = 0.011). In the sub-analysis, the hope-agency subdomain was significantly associated with lower rates of relapse (HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.41-0.83; p = 0.009), while the hope-pathway subdomain was not significantly associated with relapse rates (HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.50-1.11; p = 0.146). Conclusions In the present study, increased mean levels of hope were associated with slower rates of relapse among people living with opioid dependence following discharge from detoxification programs. These findings suggest that empowering people in recovery and providing additional support following services such as detoxification may be valuable strategies to reduce relapse rates among people living with opioid dependence.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 0 Total Times Cited: 0 Cited Reference Count: 48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Psychiatric health condition - Substance misuse",10.1080/16066359.2022.2132238,"Hope;relapse;opioid dependence;detoxification;recovery;RECOVERY SUPPORT;HOMELESS PEOPLE;SUBSTANCE;HEALTH;INDIVIDUALS;VALIDATION;RETENTION;EPIDEMIC;PATHWAYS;SERVICES;Recurrence;Analgesics, Opioid",,,Y,N,Included

There is little information regarding perceived support in the early phase of illness. The aim of this study was to describe social support, networks and perceived satisfaction, explore the clinical correlates of these outcomes and examine whether phases of untreated psychosis are linked with social network variables to determine potential opportunities for intervention. METHODS: During the study period, we assessed 222 people with first-episode psychosis at entry into treatment using valid and reliable measures of diagnosis, positive and negative symptoms, periods of untreated psychosis and prodrome and premorbid adjustment. For follow-up we contacted participants to conduct a second assessment (n=158). There were 97 people who participated which represented 61% of those eligible. Social network and support information obtained at both time points included the number of friends, self-reported satisfaction with support and social network size and clinician's evaluation of the degree of support received through networks. Mixed effects modelling determined the contribution of potential explanatory variables to social support measured. RESULTS: A number of clinical variables were linked with social networks, support and perceived support and satisfaction. The size of networks did not change over time but those with no friends and duration of untreated psychosis was significantly longer for those with no friends at entry into treatment (n=129, Median=24.5mths, IQR=7.25-69.25; Mann-Whitney U=11.78, p=0.008). Social support at baseline and at one year was predicted by homelessness (t=-2.98, p=0.001, CI -4.74 to -1.21), duration of untreated psychosis (t=-0.86, p=0.031, CI -1.65 to -0.08) and premorbid adjustment (t=-2.26, p=0.017, CI -4.11 to -0.42). Social support improved over time but the duration of untreated psychosis was not linked with the rate of improvement in this outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Improved social support could indicate greater reliance on social support or becoming more adept at mobilising resources to meet social needs. Particularly vulnerable groups with very long duration of untreated psychosis confirm the need for earlier intervention or targeted social network interventions to preserve social connectedness.","1873-491x     Renwick, Laoise     Owens, Liz     Lyne, John     O'Donoghue, Brian     Roche, Eric     Drennan, Jonathan     Sheridan, Ann     Pilling, Mark     O'Callaghan, Eadbhard     Clarke, Mary     Journal Article     England     Int J Nurs Stud. 2017 Nov;76:28-35. doi: 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2017.08.015.

Rhoades, Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, University of Southern California, 1149 S. Hill Street, Los Angeles, CA, United States","Background: Substance use disorders are common among persons experiencing homelessness, and research has identified social networks as important correlates of substance use in this population. Permanent supportive housing (PSH), particularly Housing First, which uses a harm reduction model not requiring substance abstinence, is a key solution for ending homelessness. However, conflicting evidence exists regarding the associations between moving into PSH and changes in substance use, and there is limited understanding of how networks may influence such changes. Methods: Using observational, longitudinal data from 421 persons before they moved in and over their first year in PSH (collected as part of a HIV-risk study), this paper assesses substance use change (alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drugs) and associations between perceived network characteristics and individual substance use. Results: Substance use remained relatively stable among participants over their first year living in PSH, although illicit substance use reduced somewhat at six months compared to baseline levels (from 18.5%â€“14.5%) and marijuana use increased slightly at 12 months (from 26.6% at baseline to 32.9%). Substance use among social network members was consistently associated with individual-level substance use, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Specific network substance use characteristics, such as proximity, location met, and social support, had differential relationships with particular substance types. Conclusions: These findings provide longitudinal evidence that changes within substance-using social networks are associated with subsequent changes in individual use and underscore the importance of interventions aimed at promoting positive social relationships for formerly homeless persons and improving PSH's social environments.","L2001003208     2018-08-07     2018-08-09 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.06.027,alcohol;cannabis;illicit drug;adult;alcoholism;article;cannabis addiction;controlled study;cross-sectional study;disease association;drug dependence;female;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;infection risk;longitudinal study;major clinical study;male;observational study;priority journal;social environment;social interaction;social network;social support;Social Support,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Homeless youth are a particularly vulnerable population with high rates of substance use. However, PDM has not been studied in a sample comprised exclusively of homeless youth. Methods: A sample of 451 homeless youth recruited from drop-in centers in Los Angeles, CA provided information on substance use, mental health, service utilization, trauma, and sexual risk behavior. Multivariable logistic regression assessed correlates of past month PDM. Results: Nearly 50% reported lifetime PDM and 21.6% reported PDM in the past month. The most frequently used prescriptions in the past month were: opioids only (24.5%), sedatives only (23.4%), and stimulants only (10.6%); 14.9% used some combination of these three types of prescription medications. Homeless youth reported that prescriptions were most commonly obtained for free from friends or relatives (24.5%). Foster care involvement was associated with decreased PDM, while hard drug use, suicidal ideation, and unprotected sex were associated with increased PDM. Conclusions: Homeless youth report high rates of PDM, and access these medications most frequently from friends and family. PDM among homeless youth clusters with other risk factors, including hard drug use, unprotected sex, and suicidal ideation. Surprisingly, foster care history was associated with decreased PDM. Programs aimed at preventing PDM among homeless youth should recognize the clustering of risk behaviors, assess prescription use/access when providing mental health services, and educate the general public about proper disposal of prescriptions.

J.",,English,,"Keele Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Keele, Staffs, England","Background Children have the right to health and countries a duty under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to facilitate this. The European Union has emphasized the importance of investing in children, but at times this seems more wish than pragmatism. Furthermore, European statistical systems do not provide any relevant data, and the degree of unmet need has hitherto been unknown. However, new ad hoc household survey data have now been published by Eurostat showing the percentage of children with a purported unmet medical or dental need and the expressed reasons for this. Method This paper critically reviews these data on children with a reported unmet medical or dental need to create an indication of the number of European children with unmet medical and dental needs, and the contributory factors. Results This paper calculates that some 1 million European children can be estimated to have an unmet medical need and 2 million children an unmet dental need, though the survey approach has some weaknesses. A probable overestimate of children affected in sample households offsets the likely failure to capture data about children in institutions, homeless, or in fractured families, or about multiple needs. The reported reasons for not obtaining treatments are a valuable first step in highlighting an important issue for Europe's children-measurement of service accessibility. Conclusion Potentially over 3 million European Union children are failing to have their health needs and their rights met. If the incoming European Commission is serious about its predecessor's promise to invest in children and to take seriously their rights, action is needed to improve quantification of unmet need and to reduce suffering and potential lasting damage.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 2 Total Times Cited: 2 Cited Reference Count: 13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1111/cch.12757,affordability;children;dental care;Europe;health care;right to health;unmet need;Only Child;Child,,,N,N,Full text screen

While correlates of stimulant use have been determined in prior research, few studies have assessed risk factors of use specifically in this high-risk population. Methods: We sampled biological women with a history of housing instability from community-based venues to participate in a cohort study. Baseline and 6-month follow-up data were used to determine the relative risk of stimulant use (crack cocaine, powder cocaine or methamphetamine) among individuals who did not use at baseline. Results: Among 260 study participants, the median age was 47 years, 70% were women of color; 47% reported having unmet subsistence needs and 53% reported abstinence from stimulants at baseline. In analyses adjusting for baseline sociodemographics and drug treatment, the risk of using stimulants within 6 months was significantly higher among women who reported recent sexual violence (Adjusted Relative Risk [ARR] =4.31; 95% CI:1.97-9.45), sleeping in a shelter or public place (ARR= 2.75; 95% CI:1.15-6.57), and using unprescribed opioid analgesics (ARR= 2.54; 95% CI:1.01-6.38). Conclusion: We found that almost half of homeless and unstably housed women used stimulants at baseline and 14% of those who did not use began within 6 months.

Riley, 1001 Potrero Ave., UCSF Mailbox 0874, San Francisco, CA, United States","Introduction: The use of controlled substances like cocaine increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial infarction (MI). However, outside of alcohol and tobacco, substance use is not included in CVD risk assessment tools. We identified the effects of using multiple substances (nicotine/cotinine, cannabis, alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and other opioids) on cardiac injury measured by high-sensitivity troponin (hsTnI) in homeless and unstably housed women. Methods: We recruited 245 homeless and unstably housed women from shelters, free meal programs and street encampments. Participants completed six monthly study visits. Adjusting for traditional CVD risk factors, we examined longitudinal associations between substance use and hsTnI. Results: Median participant age was 53 years and 74 % were ethnic minority women. At baseline, 76 % of participants had hypertension, 31 % were HIV-positive, 8% had a history of a prior MI and 12 % of prior stroke. The most commonly used substances were cotinine/nicotine (80 %), cannabis (68 %) and cocaine (66 %). HsTnI exceeding the 99th percentile (14.7 ng/L) â€“ a level high enough to signal possible MI â€“ was observed in 14 participants during >1 study visit (6%). In adjusted analysis, cocaethylene and fentanyl were significantly associated with higher hsTnI levels. Conclusions: Fentanyl use and the co-use of cocaine and alcohol are associated with myocardial injury, suggesting that the use of these substances may act as long-term cardiac insults. Whether risk counseling on these specific substances and/or including their use in CVD risk stratification would improve CVD outcomes in populations where substance use is high merits further investigation.","L2007738981     2020-09-11     2020-09-18 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108252,ADVIA;CardioPhase;hematology analyzer;alcohol;cannabis;cocaine;cotinine;diamorphine;fentanyl;homococaine;levamisole;methamphetamine;nicotine;troponin I;adult;article;blood sampling;cardiovascular risk;cerebrovascular accident;ethnic group;female;heart infarction;heart injury;homeless woman;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient;hypertension;longitudinal study;lowest income group;medical history;middle aged;priority journal;risk assessment;substance use;Troponin;Troponin I;Troponin T;Troponin C,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

We sought to identify factors influencing patient use of healthcare services, identify current attitudes of homeless patients towards healthcare services in Ireland and suggest areas for improvement in the training of healthcare staff in treating homeless patients. Methods: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were completed with homeless in-patients in St James's Hospital (SJH). Interviews addressed three core areas; (1) general experience of healthcare, (2) general experience of healthcare staff, and (3) suggested improvements to healthcare. Results: Ten (10) interviews were completed on patients with a mean age of 46 years, 80% of whom were male. All participants experienced substance abuse. Lack of mental stimulation within the hospital setting (n=7), insufficient detoxification programmes (n=6) and poor communication by healthcare professionals (HCP) (n=6) were identified as factors contributing to a negative healthcare experience. Perceived discrimination by HCPs associated with addiction (n=5), insufficient notice prior to discharge (n=4), and a lack of mental health supports (n=3) were also recorded comments from the study cohort. Conclusion: This study has identified key areas that negatively impact on healthcare experience in a homeless population of in-patients.

Significant predictors of treatment dropout included older age of the client, higher levels of education, higher levels of debt, online gambling, gambling on poker, shorter duration of treatment, higher depression, experience of previous treatment programmes and medication, and adverse childhood experiences. Within non-completers, significant predictors of enforced dropout included lifetime homelessness, less debt, sports gambling, depression and lifetime smoking. Those who were on a longer treatment programme and had previously received gambling treatment or support were less likely to be asked to leave. Clinicians working in inpatient support need to be aware of the increased psychopathogical and psychosocial problems in those who are at risk of termination and make attempts to retain them in treatment and increase patient compliance.","1573-3602     Roberts, Amanda     Orcid: 0000-0002-2889-9551     Murphy, Raegan     Turner, John     Sharman, Steve     RIF2015-14/University of Lincoln Research Investment Fund/     Journal Article     United States     J Gambl Stud. 2020 Mar;36(1):373-386. doi: 10.1007/s10899-019-09876-7. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10899-019-09876-7,"Adult;Aged;Behavior, Addictive/*psychology/rehabilitation;Female;Gambling/*psychology/rehabilitation;Health Status;Humans;Logistic Models;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Dropouts/*psychology/statistics & numerical data;Residential Treatment/*methods;Self Report;United Kingdom;Disordered gambling;Gambling;Inpatient;Residential treatment;Treatment dropout;receives funding from the Society for the Study of Addiction 3-year Academic;Fellowship, has previously received grants from GambleAware and the NIHR, and was;employed on ARâ€™s Research Investment Fund award.

We investigated these relationships among men and sought to determine whether links were attenuated by alcohol and drug use problems. METHODS: A cross-sectional UK representative general population survey was conducted in 2009 with 3025 men aged 18-64years. Measurements included self-reported gambling behaviours, as measured by the South Oaks Gambling Scale (SOGS) and traumatic or stressful life events. Covariates included alcohol and drug dependence and socio-demographics. Binary logistic regression models were used to examine associations. RESULTS: Problem gambling (SOGS 3-4) and probable pathological gambling (SOGS 5+) were associated with increased odds of trauma in childhood (e.g. violence in the home (Adjusted Odd Ratios (AOR) 3.0 (CI=1.8-5.0) and 2.6 (CI=1.7-4.1) respectively), and life stressors in adulthood (e.g. intimate partner violence (AORs 4.5 (CI=2.0-10.3) and 4.7 (CI=2.3-9.7) and homelessness (AORs 2.2 (CI=1.1-4.6) and 3.2 (CI=1.9-5.5)). Results were attenuated when adjusted for probable alcohol and drug dependence with the latter having largest effects. CONCLUSIONS: Among men in the United Kingdom, disordered gambling remains uniquely associated with trauma and life stressors in childhood and adulthood after adjusting for alcohol and drug dependence. The results support a need for disordered gambling treatment services to undertake routine screening for alcohol, drugs, IPV and traumatic life events and to tailor treatment that specifically targets the effects of stress for clients who present with such a cluster of issues.","1873-6327     Roberts, Amanda     Sharman, Stephen     Coid, Jeremy     Murphy, Raegan     Bowden-Jones, Henrietta     Cowlishaw, Sean     Landon, Jason     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     Addict Behav. 2017 Dec;75:95-102. doi: 10.1016/j.addbeh.2017.07.002.

Method: All the information was extracted from existing databases. Amphetamine-using clients in the criminal justice system in Sweden were identified using the European version of the addiction severity index (Europ-ASI) interview. Between 2001 and 2006, a total of 1709 individuals were identified. A follow-up of the subjects, using national registry data, was conducted in 2010. The outcome measure was hospitalization for primary or substance-induced psychotic episodes during the follow-up period. Data was analyzed in a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Age of onset of amphetamine use, number of years used, and use in the month prior to baseline interview were all unrelated to risk of future hospitalization due to psychosis. Prior psychiatric hospitalization and experience of hallucinations not related to drug use, as well as being born outside of a Nordic country and being homeless, were all positively linked to hospitalization due to psychosis. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that, in a cohort of amphetamine users within the criminal justice system, prior psychiatric morbidity and demographic risk factors are more important than baseline patterns of amphetamine use in predicting future risk of hospitalization due to psychosis.

The aim of this work is to describe the response of the Mental Health Network of the SalamancaÂ´ Area (Spain) to this crisis and the reorganization of its resources within the first 8 weeks after the state of alarm was declared. The Psychiatry Service applied a contingency plan which included the reorganization of the human resources, the closure of some of the units and the implementation of telemedicine programs along with two specific programs, namely a mental health assistance program in the context of the infection by coronavirus, and another program for homeless people. 9.038 phone interviews were carried out in the outpatients and community mental health programs. The activity in subacute and acute wards, as well as that of the day hospital programs was decreased to 50%. Based on that this real-world response provided we concluded that the usage of telemedicine is promising in patients with any kind of disorder.

As the United States weighs their merits and legality, research is needed to estimate acceptability and use among populations at high risk for overdose. We examine willingness to use OPS among street-based female sex workers (FSW) with prevalent drug use and associated morbidities. Methods: We describe self-reported willingness, barriers and conditions around use of a hypothetical OPS among 141 FSW engaged in active drug use in Baltimore City, and describe trends using Pearson's Ï‡2 and Fisher's exact tests. Results: Most women had history of overdose (55 %) and were likely to use OPS (77 %). Willingness was higher among women who: were sexual minorities (97 %;P=0.002),experienced homelessness (82 %;P=0.019), injected drugs (82 %;P=0.013), shared syringes (82 %;P=0.007), experienced sexual violence (92 %;P=0.045) or reported heroin use (83 %;P=0.039) in the past 3 months. Common anticipated barriers included transportation (45 %) and fear of arrest (41 %). Conclusions: This study highlights a population of uniquely high-risk women who would benefit from an OPS integrated with other services.

Little is known about the specific practice of injecting someone else's drug residue as a possible route of HCV transmission. Methods: A prospective cohort study of street youth aged 14-23. years old was carried out between July 2001 and December 2005. For this analysis, youth who injected in the six months prior to interview were selected if they were HCV-negative and had completed at least one follow-up visit. Semi-annual visits involved completing an interviewer-administered questionnaire and providing a blood sample for HCV antibody testing. "" Sharing behaviors"" (any injection preparation behavior that could entail IDUs using injection equipment used by others) including injecting someone else's drug residue were assessed at each interview. Predictors of HCV seroconversion were identified using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Two multivariate models were built, one considering sharing behaviors only, and one with cocaine injection forced into it. Results: Of the 175 participants, 60% were male and their mean age was 20.7. years old. In both models, residue injection was a predictor of HCV incidence, although with marginal statistical significance. The adjusted hazard ratio estimates were (2.15; 95% CI 0.99-4.67) and (2.11; 95% CI 0.97-4.62) respectively. Conclusion: This epidemiological study underscores the role injection of drug residue may play in HCV transmission among IDUs.

Rudolph, 722 W 168th St., Room 522, New York, NY, United States","Background: Relapse rates during opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment remain unacceptably high. It is possible that optimally matching patients with medication type would reduce risk of relapse. Our objective was to learn a rule by which to assign type of medication for OUD to reduce risk of relapse, and to estimate the extent to which risk of relapse would be reduced if such a rule were used. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of an open-label randomized controlled, 24-week comparative effectiveness trial of injection extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), delivered approximately every 28 days, or daily sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) for treating OUD, 2014â€“2017 (N = 570). Outcome was a binary indicator of relapse to regular opioid use during the 24 weeks of outpatient treatment. Results: We found that applying an estimated individualized treatment ruleâ€”i.e., a rule that assigns patients with OUD to either XR-NTX or BUP-NX based on their individual characteristics in such a way that risk of relapse is minimizedâ€”would reduce risk of relapse by 24 weeks by 12% compared to randomly assigned treatment. Conclusions: The number-needed-to-treat with the estimated treatment rule to prevent a single relapse is 14. A simpler, alternative estimated rule in which homeless participants would be treated with XR-NTX and stably housed participants would be treated with BUP-NX performed similarly. These results provide an estimate of the amount by which a relatively simple change in clinical practice could be expected to improve prevention of OUD relapse.","L2014567003     2021-09-20     2021-09-29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109031,"NCT02032433;buprenorphine;naltrexone;adult;alternative medicine;article;clinical practice;comparative study;controlled study;drug dependence;drug effect;drug use;homeless person;human;major clinical study;outcome assessment;outpatient care;patient participation;randomized controlled trial;relapse;risk factor;risk reduction;sustained drug release;treatment duration;treatment outcome;Buprenorphine;Naltrexone;Analgesics, Opioid",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methodology/approach â€“ The study begins by reviewing the literature on pioneering American initiatives dating back to the 1970s and more recent literature from Great Britain where a series of high-profile scandals involving sexual exploitation of teenage girls provoked a number of controversial inquiries into the police and social work professions. The present study was prompted by an evaluation of the 116 000 Missing Children Hotline which was introduced to Ireland in 2012 under the auspices of the European Union (EU) Daphne III Programme by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC). Findings â€“ The central conclusion emerging from analysis of the evidence is that Missing Children Hotlines remain rooted in representations of â€˜stranger dangerâ€™ and disconnected from repeat runaway children who feature prominently in police reports from formal care settings or family homes and who are actively targeted by sexual predators and criminal gangs. The implications are that systemic change requires grounding in research strategies which combine police data with anthropological studies to give legitimacy to the voices of runway and sexually exploited children. Originality/value â€“ The study offers original international perspectives on missing children to epistemological research communities in the fields of social work, criminology and policing with recommendations that Missing Children and Runaway Safe-lines are targeted systemically at keeping runaway children, homeless children and at-risk-youth safe and off the streets.

Our analysis: 1) identified latent classes of support received by participants; 2) determined whether class membership differed by current (â‰¤12 months) vs. former (>12 months) injection drug use; 3) compared classes of support by individual and network characteristics. Results: 970 participants listed 3,388 network members. We identified three support classes: (1) Moderate (n = 249): probabilities of support <0.40; (2) High (n = 366): probabilities of support 0.58-0.82; (3) Very high (n = 355): probabilities of support 0.91-0.99. In adjusted analysis compared to moderate support, the odds of high and very high support increased as the mean age of network members increased (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]:1.03; 95 % CI: 1.01, 1.05) and as the number of network members with whom they interacted daily increased (AOR-high: 1.33; 95 % CI:1.14, 1.56 and AOR-very high: 1.54; 95 % CI: 1.30, 1.83). While current injection drug use was associated with lower unadjusted odds of high and very high support, the associations were not statistically significant in adjusted analysis. Conclusions: Support was higher among networks of older ties and more frequent interaction, but differences did not appear to be driven by injection drug use status. Findings point to the importance of the closest social ties.","L2004536943     2020-01-09     2020-01-15 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107816,adult;age distribution;alcoholism;article;cannabis addiction;cocaine dependence;controlled study;cross-sectional study;demography;depression;ethnic difference;female;health behavior;health care survey;heroin dependence;high risk behavior;homeless person;human;injection drug user;latent class analysis;major clinical study;male;priority journal;social interaction;social network;social status;social support;Social Support,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

We sought to explore admission trends for AAPI, demographic and treatment variable change, and individual state admission change over time. Methods: We used retrospective time-series logistic regression treating year as a predictor of yearly treatment admission trends, between-state test for heterogeneity of treatment effects among states' AAPI admissions, and percent-changes of AAPI demographic and treatment characteristics. Participants included AAPI (n = 135,356) and comparison non-AAPI (n = 8,938,982) treatment groups' first-time admissions (N = 9,074,338) in United States treatment centers receiving public funding from 2000 to 2012. Results: AAPI demonstrated a greater increase in admissions than non-AAPI from 2000 to 2012 (p < 0.0001; OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.019-1.022). Large percent increases were demonstrated in multiple demographic and treatment characteristic, most notably in prescription opioids as a problem substance, age of first use for the oldest and youngest groups, and homelessness. In addition, trends are provided for individual states to help prioritize resource need. Conclusions: The present demographic and treatment characteristics revealed specific variables that may help to improve a culturally competent understanding of increasing risk factors among AAPI clients. The present findings may help to demonstrate which states may need to increase AAPI-specific resources and interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Three hundred and nineteen women were recruited from drug courts. Rates of exposure and likelihood of traumatic events leading to PTSD were examined, sociodemographic characteristics were compared across groups, and a logistic regression analysis was conducted to test for differences in PTSD risk for assaultive vs. non-assaultive events. Twenty percent of participants met PTSD criteria, 71% had trauma exposure without PTSD, and 9% did not endorse any traumatic events. Prostitution and homelessness were more prevalent in women with vs. without a history of trauma, but among trauma-exposed women prevalences did not vary by PTSD status. No differences in risk for PTSD were found between assaultive and non-assaultive events (OR=0.91; 95%CI: 0.48-1.75). Women sentenced to drug court represent a heavily trauma-exposed population, for whom risk for PTSD is not limited to assaultive events.

Prompt patient help-seeking for signs and symptoms suggestive of lung cancer is crucial for early referral, diagnosis, and survivorship. However, individuals with potential lung cancer symptoms tend to delay help-seeking. This qualitative study explored perceived barriers to patient help-seeking and strategies to enhance help-seeking for lung cancer warning signs and symptoms from the perspective of primary healthcare professionals. METHODS: Semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 36 primary healthcare professionals. Data were collected via videoconferencing. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The following two themes were created from the data: (i) perceived barriers to patient help-seeking for signs and symptoms of concern and (ii) facilitating early patient presentation for signs and symptoms of concern. Some participants believed that the high cost of a general practitioner visit, long waiting times, and previous bad experiences with the healthcare system would deter patients from seeking help for symptoms of lung cancer. Perceived patient-related barriers to help-seeking related to the different emotions associated with a potential cancer diagnosis as well as stigma, embarrassment, and guilt felt by smokers. Sociodemographic factors such as drug use, homelessness, living in rural areas, and being male and older were also perceived to impede patient help-seeking. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer help-seeking also featured strongly. Participants recommended several strategies to enable patients to seek help for symptoms of concern including targeted educational campaigns focussing on symptoms (e.g., cough) rather than behaviours (e.g., smoking), accessible and free health services, and using patients' support networks. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-related and healthcare system-related barriers to help-seeking for lung cancer warning signs and symptoms include cost of healthcare, cancer fear, and various sociodemographic factors. Participants suggested that increased awareness and early patient help-seeking for symptoms of concern could be achieved through targeted patient education, national campaigns, the use of community support networks, and free and accessible targeted screening services.","2731-4553     Saab, Mohamad M     O'Driscoll, Michelle     FitzGerald, Serena     Sahm, Laura J     Leahy-Warren, Patricia     Noonan, Brendan     Kilty, Caroline     Lyons, Noreen     Burns, Heather E     Kennedy, Una     Lyng, Ãine     Hegarty, Josephine     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     BMC Prim Care. 2022 May 18;23(1):119. doi: 10.1186/s12875-022-01730-x. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Physical health condition - Cancer",10.1186/s12875-022-01730-x,*covid-19;Female;Humans;*Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis;Male;Pandemics;Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology;Primary Health Care;Early detection;Focus group;General practitioners;Help-seeking behavior;Lung cancer;Nurses;Pharmacists;Primary care;Qualitative research;Lung Neoplasms;Lung,,,Y,N,Included

Methods 433 transgender persons aged 16+ completed a respondent-driven sampling survey in 2009â€“2010. Analyses were weighted using RDS II methods, including frequencies and prevalence ratios. Overall and sex-specific estimates of HED among Ontario residents in the 2009â€“2010 Canadian Community Health Survey (nÂ =Â 39,980) were standardized to the overall and gender-specific transgender age distributions. Results Estimated prevalence of HED at least monthly among transgender Ontarians was 33.2% (95% CI: 26.3, 40.1), 1.5 times greater than expected based on the age-standardized Ontario population. Transmasculine (female-to-male spectrum) persons were more likely than transfeminine persons to report HED (42.2% versus 22.7%), an effect robust to covariate adjustment. Current sex work was associated with greater HED, but gender transition and social exclusion factors were not. Conclusion Gendered pathways to alcohol misuse, particularly among transmasculine persons, warrant further research and intervention development.","L613265125     2016-11-22     2017-01-17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.011,adult;age distribution;aged;alcohol consumption;article;binge drinking;Canada;child abuse;child parent relation;controlled study;demography;depression;education;employment status;female;female to male transgender;health care disparity;health care system;health survey;homelessness;human;income;major clinical study;male;male to female transgender;participatory research;predictor variable;prevalence;priority journal;prostitution;sexual assault;sexual and gender minority;social exclusion;social stigma;social support;transgender;Drinking,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

However, little research has examined the reach of overdose education and naloxone trainings among people who inject drugs (PWID). Understanding gaps in coverage is essential to improving the public health response to the ongoing crisis. Methods: We surveyed 298 PWID in Baltimore City, MD. We conducted a latent class analysis of drug use indicators and tested for differences by class in past month overdose, having received overdose training, and currently having naloxone. Results: Three classes emerged: cocaine/heroin injection (40.2%), heroin only injection (32.2%), and multi-drug/multi-route use (27.6%). The prevalence of past month overdose differed marginally by class (p = 0.06), with the multi-drug/multi-route use class having the highest prevalence (22.5%) and the heroin only class having the lowest (4.6%). The prevalence of previous overdose training differed significantly by class (p = 0.02), with the heroin/cocaine class (76.5%) having more training than the other two classes. Training was least common amongst the multi-drug/multi-route class (60.3%), though not statistically different from the heroin only class (63.0%). Classes did not differ significantly in current naloxone possession, although the multi-drug/multi-route class exhibited the lowest prevalence of naloxone possession (37.2%). Conclusions: People who inject multiple substances are at high risk for overdose and are also the least likely to receive overdose trainings. The current service landscape does not adequately reach individuals with high levels of structural vulnerability and high levels of drug use and homelessness. Actively including this subgroup into harm reduction efforts are essential for preventing overdose fatalities.","L2002091459     2019-06-14     2019-06-21 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.03.026,cocaine;diamorphine;naloxone;adult;article;drug use;female;high risk population;homelessness;human;injection drug user;intoxication;latent class analysis;major clinical study;male;Maryland;prevalence;priority journal;substance use;Baltimore,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This paper reports on the results of a 3-month small scale intervention which explored the efficacy, challenges and opportunities of using electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) to support cessation of tobacco smoking with people accessing an Irish supported temporary accommodation (STA) homeless service. It considers the results of this intervention with reference to the balance of harms between the use of vaping to support smoking cessation and continued smoking. METHODS: Twenty-three participants were recruited. Demographic data, carbon monoxide (CO) measurements, homelessness status and smoking history were recorded. Participants were given an ENDS device and two 10-ml bottles containing e-liquid available in several flavours and at several strengths. Participants could pick up new bottles on a weekly basis. At weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12, the FagerstrÃ¶m Test and Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS) were administered. RESULTS: Over 75% of the residents in the participating hostel were recruited (23/30). However, there was a substantial loss to follow-up (n = 14) as a result of data protection issues, the transient nature of the population of interest and non-compliance with the intervention. Self-reported reductions in cigarette consumption were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). However, reductions in carbon monoxide measurements were not statistically significant. Decreases in FagerstrÃ¶m Nicotine Dependence Test were statistically significant (p = 0.001), but decreases in MPSS ""urge to smoke"" and ""strength of urges"" composite scores were not. Reported side effects included coughing, runny nose, bleeding nose, slight sweating, dizziness, increased phlegm and a burning sensation at the back of the throat. Barriers to engagement were peer norms, vaping restrictions in accommodation and adverse life events. Positive effects reported included increased energy, less coughing, better breathing and financial benefits. An improvement in the domain ""poor concentration"" was also found to be statistically significant (p = 0.040). CONCLUSION: ENDS-based interventions may be effective with this population. Future research should aim to improve follow-up, consider including behavioural components and monitor health effects in relation to ongoing concerns around risks and the balance of harms.

SW personnel play a pivotal role in some EDs but are not integrated into the team in several jurisdictions. Our objective was to provide a detailed description of the need for SW support in the ED setting by describing SW consultation patterns in an urban ED location. Methods A three-year analysis of ED SW referrals made through a network of four acute care hospitals serving a city population of 1.2 million inhabitants where social workers operate from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The study design was descriptive reporting proportions. The descriptors of interest were the types of ED patients receiving SW consultations and the reasons for patient referral to the SW Department. Results During the study period, there were 46,970 SW consultations, representing 8.02% of the 572,804 patients who visited the ED across Calgary, yielding 42.9 referrals per day to social workers through the ED. Consultations for domestic violence were three times more prevalent for women (6% of referrals). However, domestic violence consultations were still an active issue for men (1.9%). Comparisons by age group yielded illness adjustments (15.3%), discharge planning (31.2%), and legal decision making (23.9%) as the most common reasons for referral of patients over 75 years old; 92.8% of patients over 75 years were admitted following the SW consultation. Reasons for deferral of patients under 30 years of age were illness adjustments (12.2%), discharge planning (16.4 %), and legal decision making (1.4%); 57.3% of patients under 30 years were admitted following the consultation. Addiction/drug use and homelessness were more common in those under the age of 30, comprising 24.1% and 15.4% of the SW referrals, respectively, compared to 1.6% and 0.4% of referrals for those over age 75, respectively. Conclusions The demand for SW support is significant and complex in these large urban EDs. However, the impact on patient care and resource use is substantial, and the data indicates that SW integration may be of universal benefit to EDs. Further studies are warranted to accurately characterize the amount and type of SW necessary for optimal patient outcomes and hospital resource use.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 5 Total Times Cited: 5 Cited Reference Count: 28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.7759/cureus.3247,"social work;emergency medicine;safety net;analysis;emergency department (ed);multidisciplinary care;LOW SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS;FREQUENT USERS;CARE;ADMISSION;ADULTS;PHYSICIANS;OUTCOMES;ASTHMA;Emergency Service, Hospital;Emergencies;Social Work",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: This study identified correlates of stigma experiences in a sample of 438 HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) who were enrolled in a sexual risk reduction intervention in San Diego, CA. Results: Approximately 96% of the sample reported experiences of stigma related to their use of methamphetamine. In multiple regression analysis, experiences of stigma were associated with binge use of methamphetamine, injection drug use, increased anger symptoms, reduced emotional support, and lifetime treatment for methamphetamine use. Conclusions: These findings suggest that experiences of stigma are common among methamphetamine users and that interventions to address this type of stigma and its correlates may offer social, psychological, and health benefits to HIV-positive methamphetamine-using MSM.

This audit aims to identify inequities in access to hospice-based SPC in a deprived and ethnically diverse borough of London. Characteristics of those who died between 2010 and 2015 who were known to the hospice were compared with population deaths over the same period. Between 2010 and 2015, the number of deaths remained stable (av. 1013) while the number of residents who used SPC services increased from 359 to 525. Only 11% male/16% female deaths known to SPC were aged 85+, while 20% male/27% female overall deaths were aged 85+. Place of birth on death certification compared with SPC users' ethnicity showed similar proportions from Bangladeshi/ other Asian groups (20%/19.6%) and Black groups (5%/5%). Fewer White British groups used SPC (53.5%) compared to the proportion of deaths of people born in the UK and Ireland (65.6%). 55% of SPC users had cancer, which caused 30% of all deaths. There was low use amongst people with circulatory (3%) and respiratory disease (5%) although these combined cause 40% of deaths. Data was not routinely recorded for groups for whom there is evidence of poor quality palliative care (learning disability, mental illness, homelessness and substance misuse). These findings suggest the hospice has a reasonable reach across ethnic groups, although may be under-accessing the oldest old. People who died from cancer were more likely to have accessed SPC. Joint working with non-cancer specialist services is currently underway to try to address this. The hospice's information team are exploring routine recording of protected characteristics such as learning disability and homelessness so that these can be part of future health equity audits.","L638695942     2022-08-16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1136/bmjspcare-2018-hospiceabs.71,adult;certification;conference abstract;controlled study;death toll;ethnic group;ethnicity;female;health equity;homelessness;hospice;human;Ireland;learning disorder;male;malignant neoplasm;mental disease;palliative therapy;place of birth;resident;respiratory tract disease;Palliative Care,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Prevalence is rising, superseding public health estimates. Chronic diseases are more common among lower socioeconomic groups, for example, the homeless population. There is paucity of data on the health status of the homeless population in Ireland, and the prevalence of diabetes and associated cardiovascular risk factors is unknown. AIM: We aimed to assess the prevalence of diabetes, pre-diabetes and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in an Irish regional homeless population. DESIGN: This study is a cross-sectional study of the homeless population living in a regional university city of Ireland. METHODS: After informed consent and following an overnight fast, blood was drawn for fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). A 75 g glucose load was given orally and an oral glucose tolerance test completed. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were recorded. Smoking, alcohol and drug status were noted. RESULTS: Of the 252 participants, 8% (n = 20), 10% (n = 24) and 21% (n = 54) were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes and MetS, respectively. Obesity (body mass index >30) was present in 22%, while 90% displayed abdominal obesity. Participants who screened positive for diabetes, pre-diabetes and MetS demonstrated an inferior cardiovascular risk profile. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of diabetes, pre-diabetes and MetS in this homeless population is in keeping with national estimates. As this cohort is less likely to seek health care, this may result in later diagnosis and a greater risk of diabetic complications at presentation.","1460-2393     Scott, J     Gavin, J     Egan, A M     Avalos, G     Dennedy, M C     Bell, M     Dunne, F     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     QJM. 2013 Jun;106(6):547-53. doi: 10.1093/qjmed/hct063.

Sharman, School of Psychology, University of East London, Stratford, London, UK, United Kingdom","Background: Disordered gambling can have serious negative consequences for the individual and those around them. Previous research has indicated that disordered gamblers are at an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, ideation and attempts. The current study sought to utilise data from a clinical sample to identify factors that are associated with prior suicide attempts. Methods: The sample included 621 patients entering a gambling-specific residential facility in the UK. A series of Chi-Square analyses and binary logistic regressions were run to identify clinical and sociodemographic variables associated with suicide attempts. Results: Of the 20 variables analysed using Chi-square statistics, five were significantly associated with the outcome variable (lifetime attempted suicide): loss of family relationships, loss of home, prior depression, prior suicidal thoughts, and medication use. Regression analysis showed that individuals were more likely to have reported suicide attempts if they had experienced loss of family relationships (1.65 times), loss of a home (1.87 times), prior depression (3.2 times), prior suicidal thoughts (6.14 times), or were taking medication (1.95 times) compared to those not reporting such individual events. Conclusions: Disordered gamblers are vulnerable to suicide; a number of factors have been identified in the current study that predict an increased likelihood of attempted suicide. The factors mainly revolve around loss: not financial loss, but rather disintegration of an individual's support network and deterioration in the individual's mental health. Findings indicate that isolation and negative affect associated with gambling are most influential in attempted suicide and should therefore be more strongly considered when creating and providing the legislative, educational and treatment environments for those experiencing gambling related harm.","L2015526666     2021-11-16     2022-01-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107171,"antidepressant agent;adolescent;adult;aged;article;cognitive behavioral therapy;depression;drug use;family relation;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;pathological gambling;residential care;risk factor;suicidal ideation;suicide attempt;United Kingdom;Suicide, Attempted;Suicide",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

These elements are explored in a series of rich case studies located in Australia, Ireland and Bangladesh, with broader implications for policy and practice in the rest of the world. The case studies highlight the growing importance of social enterprise and social entrepreneurship in fostering social capital and in contributing to the idea of â€œthe enabling stateâ€.

To address disparities in the overdose crisis among individuals with criminal legal involvement, it is important to understand variation in SUD treatment across states. Methods: We conducted a retrospective comparison of substance use treatment referrals from the criminal legal system and other sources across participating states. Using data from the 2018â€“2019 Treatment Episode Dataset-Admissions, we characterized treatment referral rates from the criminal legal system, the substances most commonly leading to treatment, and rates of treatment with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) across states. Results: Across all states, criminal legal referral rates were higher than non-criminal legal rates. Criminal-legal referral rates, adjusted for state overdose deaths, were highest in the Northeast and Midwest. Methamphetamine use was the most common substance leading to treatment referral from the criminal legal system in 24 states while opioid use was the most common reason for non-criminal legal referrals in 34 states. In over half the states analyzed, fewer than 10% of opioid treatment referrals from the criminal legal system received MOUD. In almost all states, MOUD was more common in treatment referred from non-criminal legal settings. Conclusion: State-specific policies and practices shape drug policy and the SUD treatment landscape for people with criminal legal involvement. Standards and ongoing monitoring for substance use treatment referrals from the criminal-legal system should be considered by federal agencies charged with addressing the ongoing overdose crisis.","L2020618825     2022-10-18     2022-10-28 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109651,methamphetamine;opiate;adult;aged;article;cohort analysis;comparative study;controlled study;death;drug dependence treatment;educational status;female;geographic distribution;government;health care access;health care disparity;hospital admission;human;male;methamphetamine dependence;middle aged;offender;opiate addiction;patient referral;retrospective study;substance use;young adult,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Sheehy, Saint Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland","Background: The number of homeless people in Ireland continues to rise. Psychiatric illness is prevalent among those living on the street, however they are often either lost to follow-up or remain undiagnosed and untreated. Of those homeless in Ireland, a proportion are immigrants, in whom language and cultural barriers can be challenging. Case presentation: YH is a 38-year-old Chinese lady who presented to SVUH in August 2016. She was brought to hospital by the GardaÃ­ following a psychotic episode and subsequently involuntarily admitted. She displayed symptoms of paranoia, ideas of reference, perceptual abnormality, delusions of control, telepathy, auditory and tactile hallucinations, and denied any previous psychiatric history at this time. With treatment as an inpatient, YH's clinical condition improved. However, she absconded and the treating team was unable to contact her as she had no relatives in Ireland and no Next-Of-Kin. She was declared a missing person to GardaÃ­ before being re-admitted in a similar manner 4 weeks later. It transpired that YH had been homeless in Dublin for 1 year and was socially isolated. She told us that she had been treated at a psychiatric hospital in China and refused to allow the team to obtain a collateral history. This lady is an educated individual with a Masters Degree in Theology, yet was facing deportation to China on the basis of an expired visa as a consequence of her relapsing condition. YH was afforded a Stamp 4 Visa by the Irish Government on humanitarian grounds. Her symptoms are reducing and she has regained insight. Significant social challenges, namely social reintegration and re-engaging with her PhD studies will be key to her discharge plan. Conclusion: This case highlights the significant social challenges to psychiatric teams in treating patients who are homeless and socially isolated. It also underscores the importance of a collateral history in assessing psychiatric patients as well as the role for transcultural psychiatry in our health service.","L617743541     2017-08-16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s11845-017-1629-5,adult;auditory hallucination;case report;China;congenital malformation;cultural psychiatry;female;follow up;government;homeless person;hospital patient;human;immigrant;Ireland;language;mental hospital;mental patient;paranoia;parapsychology;relative;theology;Psychotic Disorders;Social Isolation;Emigrants and Immigrants,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Efficacious cessation interventions have been developed but the uptake among low SES communities has been more than slow. CEASE (Communities Engaged and Advocating for a Smoke-free Environment) is a research partnership to address tobacco use in two low-income urban communities. We report the latest Phases of our CBPR project that sought to combine rigorous research with â€œBest-Practicesâ€ models and community action. Methods: CEASE smoking cessation program is a 12-week support group intervention led by peer-motivators. The Program was developed through two consecutive trials (Phase I & II, n = 404 & 398), comparing a clinical model of care with a community-based support group. Based on lessons learned, Phase III intervention (n = 163) was conducted to disseminate the CEASE intervention among organizations serving vulnerable populations (e.g., mental health clinics, addiction treatment programs, non-profit organization serving homeless clients, etc.). New tools were developed for motivation enhancement, quit smoking, and relapse prevention. Results: Cessation rates in Phase I and II were 9.4% to 24.4%, respectively. In Phase II compared to Phase I retention rate (attending more than six sessions) increased from 13.6% to 50.8%. The Phase III results showed 22.1% cessation and 67.5% retention rates. Overall, the odds of quitting increased about 40% per each session attended in the program in all three phases (OR = 1.4, CI = 1.3, 1.5). Conclusions: Translating evidence-based interventions require addressing barriers that affect their effectiveness. A communitybased peer-led support group is an effective way to ensure fit between users' needs, expectations, and problems.","L618520762     2017-10-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.516,addiction;expectation;human;language;major clinical study;motivation;non profit organization;participatory research;phase 1 clinical trial;relapse;smoking cessation program;support group;vulnerable population,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Shared-care with the HFH service whereby patients gave permission for results to be copied to the GP service. Results Between September 2013 and January 2017, there were 498 clinic attendances, with 109 (22%) females, and 389 (78%) male clients. Of all attendances, 181 (36%) accepted sexual health screening. Of these, 17 (9.4%) were diagnosed with a sexual infection and/or hepatitis C, including 7 (3.9%) of chlamydia; 4 (2.2%) of new hepatitis C infection; 3 (1.6%) of genital warts; and 1 (0.6%) of: gonorrhoea, herpes and molluscum contagiosum. All infections were treated. 5 (5%) females had cervical cytological assessment. A 140-strong sample of notes were scrutinised to ascertain examination uptake. Of 82 indicated examinations, 26 (32%) accepted, 56 (68%) clients declined. Poor uptake may account for the low rate of skin conditions diagnosed. 20 (4%) attendances culminated in vaccination.

Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge, CB2 0SR, UK.     Department of Clinical Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 8, Dublin, D08 NHY1, Ireland.","Background: Over the last several years, homelessness has increased in Ireland and across Europe. Rates have recently declined since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but it is unclear whether emergency housing measures will remain in place permanently. Populations experiencing long-term homelessness face a higher burden of multi-morbidity at an earlier age than housed populations and have poorer health outcomes. However, this population also has more difficulty accessing appropriate health services. A realist review by the authors found that important health system contexts which impact access are resourcing, training, funding cycles, health system fragmentation, health system goals, how care is organised, culture, leadership and flexibility of care delivery. Using a realist evaluation approach, this research will explore and refine key system-level factors, highlighted in our realist review, in a local health care system. Aim: The aim of this study is to understand how funding procedures and health system performance management impact service settings, staff, providers and their ability to make services accessible to populations experiencing homelessness. Methods: A realist evaluation will be undertaken to explain how funding and health system performance management impact healthcare accessibility for populations experiencing homelessness. Data will be collected using qualitative and realist interview techniques and focus group methodology. Secondary data such as policy documents and budgets will utilised. The analysis will follow Pawson and Tilley's iterative phases starting with building an Initial programme theory, then data collection, data analysis, synthesis and finally building a refined programme theory. Conclusion: Building on a realist review conducted by the same research team, this study will further test and refine findings that explain how health system factors impact healthcare accessibility for populations experiencing homelessness. The study has the potential to inform policy makers, health planners and managers of contextual factors that can be modified to increase healthcare accessibility.","2515-4826     Siersbaek, Rikke     Orcid: 0000-0003-3223-1420     Ford, John     NÃ­ Cheallaigh, ClÃ­ona     Orcid: 0000-0002-0842-425x     Burke, Sara     Orcid: 0000-0001-9419-1642     Thomas, Steve     Orcid: 0000-0001-9306-0114     Journal Article     Ireland     HRB Open Res. 2021 Jan 21;3:73. doi: 10.12688/hrbopenres.13154.2. eCollection 2020. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: protocol",10.12688/hrbopenres.13154.2,Access to healthcare;Homeless adult;Homelessness;Inclusion health;Realist evaluation,,,N,N,Full text screen

Peer-reviewed articles were identified through a systematic search, grey literature search, citation tracking and expert recommendations. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were assessed for rigour and relevance and coded to identify data relating to contexts, mechanisms and/or outcomes. Analysis Inductive and deductive coding was used to generate context-mechanism-outcome configurations, which were refined and then used to build several iterations of the overarching programme theory. Results Systematic searching identified 330 review articles, of which 24 were included. An additional 11 grey literature and primary sources were identified through citation tracking and expert recommendation. Additional purposive searching of grey literature yielded 50 records, of which 12 were included, for a total of 47 included sources. The analysis found that healthcare access for populations experiencing homelessness is improved when services are coordinated and delivered in a way that is organised around the person with a high degree of flexibility and a culture that rejects stigma, generating trusting relationships between patients and staff/practitioners. Health systems should provide long-term, dependable funding for services to ensure sustainability and staff retention. Conclusions With homelessness on the rise internationally, healthcare systems should focus on high-level factors such as funding stability, building inclusive cultures and setting goals which encourage and support staff to provide flexible, timely and connected services to improve access.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 3 Total Times Cited: 3 Cited Reference Count: 81 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043091,health policy;organisation of health services;public health;social medicine;PALLIATIVE CARE;MENTAL-HEALTH;PEOPLE;NEEDS;BARRIERS;INTERVENTIONS;FACILITATORS;TUBERCULOSIS;CHALLENGES;PROVISION,,,N,N,Full text screen

The purpose of this study is to provide an updated systematic review of population-based prevalence estimates and to understand the factors that could account for this variation in prevalence estimates. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycInfo databases were searched for observational studies describing schizophrenia prevalence in general populations from 2003-2013 and supplemented by studies from a prior review covering 1990-2002. Studies reporting prevalence estimates from specialized populations such as institutionalized, homeless, or incarcerated persons were excluded. Prevalence estimates were compared both across and within studies by factors that might contribute to variability using descriptive statistics. Results: Sixty-five primary studies were included; thirty-one (48 %) were from Europe and 35 (54 %) were conducted in samples of >= 50,000 persons. Among 21 studies reporting 12-month prevalence, the median estimate was 0.33 % with an interquartile range (IQR) of 0.26 %-0.51 %. The median estimate of lifetime prevalence among 29 studies was 0.48 % (IQR: 0.34 %-0.85 %). Prevalence across studies appeared to vary by study design, geographic region, time of assessment, and study quality scores; associations between study sample size and prevalence were not observed. Within studies, age-adjusted estimates were higher than crude estimates by 17 %-138 %, the use of a broader definition of schizophrenia spectrum disorders compared to schizophrenia increased case identification by 18 %-90 %, identification of cases from inpatient-only settings versus any setting decreased prevalence by 60 %, and no consistent trends were noted by differing diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: This review provides updated information on the epidemiology of schizophrenia in general populations, which is vital information for many stakeholders. Study characteristics appear to play an important role in the variation between estimates. Overall, the evidence is still sparse; for many countries no new studies were identified.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 147 Total Times Cited: 149 Cited Reference Count: 107 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s12888-015-0578-7,HEALTH INSURANCE ENROLLEES;MAJOR MENTAL-DISORDERS;GENERAL-POPULATION;PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS;PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS;LIFETIME PREVALENCE;RURAL IRELAND;DIAGNOSED SCHIZOPHRENIA;NONAFFECTIVE PSYCHOSIS;ADMINISTRATIVE DATA;Schizophrenia;Prevalence,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Simon, UW School of Medicine, 1959 NE Pacific St A-300 Health Sciences Center, Box 356340, Seattle, WA, United States","Background: Office-based buprenorphine treatment promises to expand effective treatment for opioid use disorder. Unfortunately, patients may be lost during engagement, before induction with medication. Few data are available regarding rates and predictors of successfully reaching induction. Methods: The sample included 100 consecutive patients seeking treatment in 2016 at an office-based buprenorphine treatment program in an urban, academic primary care clinic. Patients completed phone intake, nurse visit and physician visit prior to induction. We reviewed electronic medical records to describe the time to complete each step and used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of reaching induction. Results: Sixty percent of the sample dropped out prior to induction, with the majority dropping out prior to the nurse visit. For patients who successfully completed induction, median time between screening and induction was 18 days (interquartile range 13-30 days). After adjustment for other factors, completing induction was significantly less likely in patients with recent polysubstance use (OR = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.04â€“0.53), prior methadone treatment (OR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.01â€“0.36), prior buprenorphine treatment (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.01â€“0.47), or other prior treatment (OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.04â€“0.98). Sociodemographic characteristics, such as younger age, minority race/ethnicity, homelessness, unemployment, history of incarceration and relationship status were not significant predictors. Conclusions: Over half of patients beginning primary care buprenorphine treatment were not successful in starting medication. Those with polysubstance use or previous substance use treatment were least likely to be successful. Programs should carefully consider barriers that might prevent treatment-seeking patients from starting medications. Some patients might need enhanced support to successfully start treatment with buprenorphine.","L620772635     2018-02-26     2018-03-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.09.017,buprenorphine;methadone;adult;age;aged;article;controlled study;electronic medical record;ethnicity;female;homelessness;human;human relation;major clinical study;male;methadone treatment;nurse;opiate addiction;physician;prediction;primary medical care;priority journal;prisoner;race;substance abuse;unemployment;Buprenorphine,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Little is known about the frequency and predictors of involuntary holds among people who inject drugs (PWID). Methods: We sought to identify the prevalence and predictors of recent TPHs (within the past 12 months) among a community-recruited sample of PWID in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California during 2017â€“2018 (N = 531). Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate demographic (e.g., age), economic (e.g., homelessness), drug use (e.g., types of drugs used), incarceration (e.g., recent arrest history) and mental health (e.g., lifetime mental health diagnosis) variables associated with recent TPH. Results: Age (40âˆ’49 years old vs age 50 or older: AOR = 5.85; 95 % CI = 2.18, 15.67), current homelessness (AOR = 3.75; 95 % CI = 1.28, 11.0), lifetime mental health history (AOR = 6.23; 95 % CI = 2.08, 18.66), and frequency of methamphetamine use (AOR = 1.01; 95 % CI = 1.00, 1.01) were statistically associated with increased odds of having experienced a TPH, while frequency of past month heroin/opioid use was associated with decreased odds of reporting a TPH (AOR = 0.99; 95 % CI = 0.99, 1.00) in multivariable analysis. Conclusions: Diverse factors were associated with TPH among PWID. Our analysis underscores the need for research on PWID with co-occurring substance-use and mental illness disorders and homelessness. There is urgent need for expanding access to lower barrier publicly funded mental health treatment from a harm-reduction approach.","L2013886719     2021-08-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108916,adult;article;California;controlled study;demography;harm reduction;homelessness;human;incarceration;injection drug user;involuntary commitment;major clinical study;mental disease;prevalence;substance use;diamorphine;methamphetamine;opiate;San Francisco;Prevalence,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Nevertheless, the author passionately believes this provides a myopic perspective, so he focuses on other factors that can account for homelessness and contribute to addressing it more holistically. People possess a sense of invincibility, but adversity can (re)visit anyone; and the experience of significant loss(es) reduces resilience. Therefore, insisting on an individualistic understanding discredits both the person and society, as people may be homeless but not hopeless. Truthfully, timely concern and intervention can meaningfully address homelessness. Optimistically, what about imbuing current neoliberal policies and reinforcing blaming rhetoric for social inequalities and disadvantage, with a reminder of our shared humanity and need for kindness? Let's challenge the power of capitalism's resilience and unjust pillars by advocating 'resilient architecture', providing an infrastructure (health, housing, education, employment, resources, well- funded services, social supports, speedy intervention for those on the margins) that enables people to live well, feel connected and flourish. These preventative measures could be complemented by encouraging a view of resilience as something everyone can learn and draw upon.

G. and Mohan, D.",,eng,,"National Forensic Mental Health Service, Central Mental Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.     Department of Psychiatry, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.     Irish Prison Service, Dublin, Ireland.","Background: Prison mental health services have tended to focus on improving the quality of care provided to mentally disordered offenders at the initial point of contact with the prison system and within the prison environment itself. When these individuals reach the end of their sentence and return to the community, there is an increased risk of morbidity, mortality, homelessness and re-imprisonment. New models of care have been developed to minimize these risks. Objectives: The objective of this project was to establish a Pre-Release Planning (PReP) Programme with social work expertise, to enhance interagency collaboration and improve continuity of care for mentally disordered offenders upon their release. We aimed to evaluate the first 2 years of the programme by measuring its success at improving the level of mental health support and the security and quality of accommodation achieved by participants upon release in comparison to that reported at time of imprisonment. Additionally, we aimed to explore the impact of these outcomes on rates of re-imprisonment. Methods: A process of participatory action research was used to develop and evaluate the first 2 years of the programme. This was a naturalistic prospective observational whole cohort study. Results: The PReP Programme supported 43 mentally disordered offenders, representing 13.7%, (43/313) of all new assessments by the prison's inreach mental health service during the 2 years study period. When compared with that reported at time of reception at the prison, gains were achieved in level of mental health support (FET p < 0.001) and security and quality of accommodation (FET p < 0.001) upon release. Of those participants seen by the PReP Programme, 20 (46.5%, 20/43) were returned to prison during the 2-years study period. There was no significant relationship between re-imprisonment and gains made in mental health support (FET p = 0.23) or accommodation (FET p = 0.23). Conclusions: We have shown that compared to that reported at time of reception at prison, the level of mental health support and the security of tenure and quality of accommodation both improved upon release following the intervention of the programme. Improved mental health support and accommodation were not associated with lower rates of re-imprisonment.","1664-0640     Smith, Damian     Harnett, Susan     Flanagan, Aisling     Hennessy, Sarah     Gill, Pauline     Quigley, Niamh     Carey, Cornelia     McGhee, Michael     McManus, Aoife     Kennedy, Mary     Kelly, Enda     Carey, Jean     Concannon, Ann     Kennedy, Harry G     Mohan, Damian     Journal Article     Switzerland     Front Psychiatry. 2018 Nov 2;9:549. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00549. eCollection 2018. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00549,continuity of care;homeless;mental health;participatory action research;prison;transition;Mental Disorders,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Smith, Kent School of Social Work, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, United States","Background Kratom use in the West has increased recently, yet the prevalence and motives for use among individuals with a history of substance use disorder (SUD) have not been fully examined. Kratom has been documented as a means of treating chronic pain, mitigating drug dependence, and easing withdrawal symptoms, yet it is unclear if substance users are utilizing kratom as a self-medication. Abuse liability, side effects, and overall appeal of kratom remain uncertain. Methods In April 2017, an anonymous survey regarding kratom use and motivations was completed by clients enrolled in a 12-Step-oriented residential program. 500 respondents with a self-reported history of SUD completed the survey. Results 20.8% of respondents endorsed lifetime kratom use and 10.2% reported past-12-month use. Kratom-users were younger (=32.1 vs. 35.9, p < 0.001) and were more versatile substance users. A majority (68.9%) of kratom-users reported having used the drug as a means of reducing or abstaining from non-prescription opioids (NPO) and/or heroin, and 64.1% reported using kratom as a substitute for NPO/heroin. 18.4% of kratom-users reported using the drug due to a disability or chronic pain. One-third of kratom-users stated that kratom was a helpful substance and that they would try it again. However, kratom was not preferred and was indicated as having less appeal than NPO, heroin, amphetamines, and Suboxone. Conclusions Among substance users, kratom use may be initiated for a variety of reasons, including as a novel form of harm-reduction or drug substitution, particularly in the context of dependence and withdrawal from other substances.","L619145827     2017-11-14     2017-11-20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.08.034,diamorphine;herbaceous agent;opiate;adult;article;chronic pain;controlled study;disability;drug dependence;female;health program;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;medical history;Mitragyna;Mitragyna speciosa;motivation;patient attitude;patient preference;prevalence;priority journal;residential care;self report;side effect;Prevalence,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

In Ireland, it extends to those who have become homeless because of an economic housing crisis, which has resulted in an unprecedented number of families living in emergency accommodation such as B&Bs and hotels. Homelessness impacts on all aspects of everyday life, not least food and eating. Using the photo-elicitation technique, the study examined how families living in emergency accommodation accessed, stored, cooked, and consumed food, the strategies they used to manage the impact of their food and eating situation, and how the overall situation in regard to food and eating made them feel. Food storage was a constant everyday pressure that impacted on food choice and dignity and constrained choices to the extent that families relied on takeaway meals and convenience foods. Regimented meal times and restricted kitchen access greatly challenged parents? food provision efforts and negatively influenced children?s and parents? dietary intake. The importance of space and the micro-contexts where food is procured, prepared, eaten and disposed is highlighted as is the need for homeless service design that supports positive family food practices and dignity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 1 Total Times Cited: 1 Cited Reference Count: 53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Conference Abstract,Nutrition and Healthy Eating",10.1080/10530789.2019.1677065,Food dignity;homelessness;photo-elicitation;families;food poverty;LOW-INCOME;DIETARY-INTAKE;SHELTERS;PEOPLE;INSECURITY;HEALTH;EXPERIENCES;BEHAVIORS;POVERTY;CHOICE;Emergencies;Ireland,,,Y,N,Included

Methods: Data were extracted from the 2009 TEDS-D dataset, a federal survey that collects data on all publicly funded drug and alcohol programs in the US, to identify client level predictors of treatment completion for outpatient and residential programs. Approximately 1.6 million cases were included in the analysis using stepwise binary logistic regression performed separately for residential and outpatient programs. Results: For residential treatment, the strongest predictors for completion were for clients whose primary substance problem was alcohol (OR = 1.40), had completed high school (OR = 1.21), had full time employment (OR = 1.97), and were older than 45 (OR = 1.19). The likelihood for non-completion was greatest for opiate users (OR = 0.80), Latinos (OR = 0.86), African Americans (OR = 0.86), those with one or more prior treatment episodes (OR = 0.94), females (0.86), and clients living independently (non-homeless) (OR = 0.72). For outpatient treatment, there was a similar but not identical pattern. The strongest predictors of program completion were alcohol as primary substance problem (OR = 1.56), high school completion (OR = 1.12), full time employment (OR = 1.25), and being a Veteran (OR = 1.10). Those least likely to complete treatment were opiate (OR = 0.50) and crack/cocaine users (OR = 0.86), African Americans (OR = 0.73), Latinos (OR = 0.88), those with one or more prior treatment epi-sodes (OR = 0.77), and more frequent drug use prior to admission (OR = 0.77). Conclusions: Given that program completion has been found to be one of the strongest indicators related to various positive addiction treatment outcomes (Brorson et al., 2013), identifying predictors of completion and non-completion for residential and outpatient programs can be useful for improving treatment retention. Further research needs to explore additional correlates of program retention and identify how programs can better address clients who are at greater risk of dropout.","L71802195     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.657,alcohol;opiate;human;United States;college;drug dependence;outpatient;African American;Hispanic;employment;high school;risk;residential care;treatment outcome;addiction;logistic regression analysis;drug use;veteran;female,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: We interviewed three hundred and forty opioid dependent persons admitted for inpatient detoxification in Fall River, Massachusetts. Potential predictors of self-reported insurance status included age, gender, ethnicity, employment, homelessness, years of education, current legal status, and self-perceived health status. Results: Participants mean age was 32 years, 71% were male, and 87% were non-Hispanic Caucasian. Twenty-three percent were uninsured. In the multivariate model, the odds of being uninsured was positively associated with years of education (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.03; 1.46, p < .05), higher among males than females (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.33; 5.20, p <. 01), and inversely associated with age (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90; 0.98, p <. 01). Conclusion: Opioid dependent persons recruited from a detoxification program in Massachusetts are uninsured at rates far above the state average. With the arrival of the Affordable Care Act, drug treatment programs in Massachusetts and nationally will be important sites to target to expand health coverage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Stewart, 85 Commercial Road, Melbourne, Australia","Background: People who inject drugs are overrepresented in prison and have diverse and complex health needs. However, outcomes after release from prison are poorly understood, limiting effective interventions supporting community reintegration. We describe the prevalence of socio-demographics, physical and mental health, alcohol and other drug use, and crime characteristics of men with histories of injecting drug use after their release from prison in Victoria, Australia. Methods: Data come from the Prison and Transition Health (PATH) prospective cohort study. Interviews were undertaken approximately three, 12, and 24 months after release from their index prison episode and were completed in the community, or in prison for those reimprisoned during the study. We present cross-sectional descriptive statistics for each follow-up wave of the PATH study. Results: Among 400 men recruited into PATH, 85 % (n = 336) completed at least one follow-up interview; 162 (42 %) completed all three interviews. Participants reported social disadvantage and health inequity, including high rates of unemployment, homelessness, and physical and mental health morbidities at each follow-up time point. Rapid return to illicit substance use was common, as was overdose (ranging 9 %â€“13 %), receptive syringe sharing (ranging 20 %â€“29 %), involvement in crime-related activities (ranging 49 %â€“58 %), and reimprisonment (ranging 22 %â€“50 %) over the duration of follow-up. Conclusion: Men in this study experienced substantial health and social challenges across a 24-month prospective follow-up period. Improved understanding of characteristics and experiences of this group after release from prison can inform more coordinated and continued care between prison and the community.","L2014402048     2021-09-07     2021-09-15 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108970,adult;alcohol consumption;article;Australia;cohort analysis;correctional facility;crime;demography;follow up;health status;homelessness;human;injection drug user;interview;longitudinal study;male;morbidity;prevalence;social aspect;social status;substance use;unemployment;Prisons;Prisoners;Victoria;Crime,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Stein, Boston University School of Public Health, 715 Albany St., 2W, Boston, MA, United States","Background: Studies of drug-using populations often restrict enrollment by limiting participation to those with a working telephone. It is unknown whether supplying phones could broaden recruitment and sustain retention among an urban population of people who inject drugs (PWID). We compare the feasibility of offering pay-by-month phones to gift card compensation as part of an ongoing randomized controlled trial of hospitalized PWID. Methods: Participants were recruited from inpatient services at an urban hospital in Boston, MA to participate in an ongoing randomized trial testing a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention. Participants who did not have their own phone at the time of enrollment were offered a pay-by-month phones as compensation for study participation. Results: Eighty-one participants met study criteria, were enrolled, and completed the study at the time of analysis. We used a generalized estimating equation to compare the overall likelihood of attending interviews during the 12-month follow-up period. Participants receiving phones tended to have lower mean educational attainment (11.4 years vs. 12.1 years), were significantly (Fisher's exact p < 0.001) more likely to report homelessness during the past 90 days (86.7% vs. 37.3%), and were significantly less likely (Fisher's exact p =.044) to be employed (3.3% vs. 20.4%) compared to those receiving gift cards. Participants in each group were equally likely to attend follow-up interviews during the study (83.3% vs. 88.3%, p = 0.53). Conclusion: Offering phones as a compensation method allows recruitment of a more disenfranchised population without impacting study retention and therefore may improve generalizability of study results.","L2000591235     2018-04-05     2018-09-07 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.11.019,mobile phone;adult;article;awareness;clinical protocol;cohort analysis;comparative study;compensation;controlled study;drug abuse;educational status;feasibility study;female;follow up;homelessness;hospital patient;hospital service;human;longitudinal study;male;Massachusetts;motivational interviewing;outcome assessment;patient participation;priority journal;randomized controlled trial (topic);urban area,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

AIM: Our aim was to identify and categorize the physical morbidities prevalent in homeless children. METHODS: A review of the English-language literature on physical morbidities affecting homeless children (defined as â‰¤â€‰18Â years of age) published from 1999 to 2019 was conducted. RESULTS: Respiratory issues were the most commonly cited illnesses affecting homeless children, including asthma, upper respiratory tract infections, and chronic cough [3]. Homeless children were described as being at increased risk for contracting infectious diseases, with many studies placing emphasis on the risks of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS transmission [4, 5]. Dermatologic concerns for this population comprised of scabies and head lice infestation, dermatitis, and abrasions [3, 6]. Malnutrition manifested as a range of physical morbidities, including childhood obesity [7], iron deficiency anemia [4], and stunted growth [8]. Studies demonstrated a higher prevalence of poor dental [7] and ocular health [9] in this population as well. Many articles also commented on the risk factors predisposing homeless children to these physical health concerns, which can broadly be categorized as limited access to health care, poor living conditions, and lack of education [3, 10]. CONCLUSION: This literature review summarized the physical illnesses prevalent among homeless children and the contributing factors leading to them. Gaps in the literature were also identified and included a dearth of studies focusing on younger children compared with adolescents. Further research into prevention and intervention programs for this vulnerable population is urgently needed.","1863-4362     Strashun, Sabina     Orcid: 0000-0002-4501-8074     D'Sa, Saskia     Foley, Deirdre     Hannon, Jessica     Murphy, Anne-Marie     O'Gorman, Clodagh S     Journal Article     Review     Ireland     Ir J Med Sci. 2020 Nov;189(4):1331-1336. doi: 10.1007/s11845-020-02233-3.

Striley, Epidemiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States","Aims: Drug users are routinely excluded from research participation, but drug use is common and non-medical exclusions unnecessarily bias research results. A NIDA ambassador intervention to increase enrollment of drug users in relevant research and change the research enterprise gave us the opportunity to study differences in the lives of drug users and non-drug users that may be linked to advances in research and treatment access. Methods: Data came from the Transformative Approach to Reduce Research Disparities Towards Drug Users study that randomized drug users and non-drug users to an ambassador (individual attention and transportation) or a standard navigator intervention (individualized study matching) to increase access to medical care and opportunities to participate in research. Final 60 day assessment of intervention effectiveness will conclude this month. For this analysis, we consider whether the lives of drug users and nonusers differ in ways that are more relevant and less discriminatory than drug use. Results: The sample is 285 community recruited adults, 18 to 80, who endorsed no drug use, and 280 who endorsed current drug use. Drug users were significantly more likely to consider themselves homeless (22% vs. 15%), be food insecure (43% vs. 35%), have unpredictable daily activities (51% vs. 39%), feel unsettled (40% vs. 31%), have more days of the month where they felt unable to control important things [8.25 (95% CI 6.91, 9.51) vs. 5.88 (4.74, 7.03)] and have more overall life chaos [4.98 (95%CI 4.61, 5.34) vs. 3.97(95%CI 3.65, 4.3)]. Evictions, jail time, having a child removed, and social support, were not different by drug use. Conclusions: Biased attitudes towards drug users, especially given the legalization of marijuana in many states, are untenable. Understanding and measuring daily life challengesamongpotential participants is important to decrease prejudicial enrollment practices, and to improve the ability to fully participate in research and attend relevant services for those who use drugs.","L72176956     2016-02-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.07.578,cannabis;college;drug dependence;drug use;human;community;adult;child;correctional facility;social support;food;medical care;traffic and transport,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Surey, University College London, Institute of Global Health, London, United Kingdom","Background and Aims: Hepatitis C disproportionately affects vulnerable groups such as the homeless, PWIDs and prison populations. In the age of DAAs community interventions are vital to reach these underserved populations if there is to be a chance of reducing prevalence and eventual elimination. The four EU HepCare sites (Ireland, UK, Spain, Romania) aim to improve identification and treatment of HCV, especially focusing on vulnerable populations with a commitment to sharing knowledge and practice. The HepFriend workpackage aims to utilise peer support in the community to increase awareness of the risk of HCV, the importance of testing, disease severity and provide treatment support. Peers, with their lived experience, can connect with underserved populations in away traditional treatment services cannot. Method: Peers were recruited and trained in HCV awareness raising and testing using a standardised method developed by the Hepatitis C Trust (UK). They were taught to deliver three simple messages: the importance of getting tested; the effectiveness of current treatment; how to avoid infection. Each site then adapted the training to meet local needs and peer networks were developed locally with NGO partners to feed into specialist HCV services. One site (London) trained peers in Fibroscan alongside the clinical team. Training was also provided in other diseases such as TB, HIV and linkage to care. Results: To date, a total of 27 peers received training: Dublin n = 12, London n = 6, Bucharest n = 3 and Sevilla n = 6. These peers have collectively carried out 216 tests and (re-)engaged 168 patients with clinical services. Of these 82 (48.8%)were started on treatment. Three sites (Dublin, London, Bucharest) made linkages with TB services, two also with HIV advocacy NGOs (Bucharest, Sevilla). The London site offered peer support linked with a mobile health unit with trained peers carrying out 70 Fibroscans. Peers have been also incorporated into OST delivery sites (Dublin n = 4, London n = 3) and the local hospital treatment network (Bucharest, Sevilla). Conclusion: Peers have a unique role in engaging with underserved populations and we have shown they can be successfully integrated into community interventions to improve case finding and treatment outcomes. Peers can also be a powerful resource to empower patients to access treatment, which is vital if we are to eliminate HCV as a public health concern, where traditional medical models have failed.","L621858882     2018-05-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: No full text available",,adult;awareness;case finding;conference abstract;elastograph;England;female;health center;hepatitis C;human;Human immunodeficiency virus;Ireland;major clinical study;male;nonhuman;peer group;personal experience;Romania;Spain;TB cell line;trust,,,N,N,Full text screen

A 55-year-old homeless man without any past medical history was found dead in a flophouse. External examination showed evidence of malnourishment and remarkable swelling of the right, lower extremity. Putrefactive discoloration in the same area was evident at the time of autopsy (approximately 30. h post-mortem). The autopsy revealed focal pneumonia in the right lower lobe, dehydration and chronic pancreatitis. Dissection of the edematous extremity revealed massive abscess formation in the subcutaneous tissue and superficial fascia around the right knee joint. Histopathological findings were compatible with necrotizing fasciitis and blood chemistry results showed an elevation of HbA1c (6.3%). The cause of death is considered to be necrotizing fasciitis and secondary pneumonia/dehydration. This case suggests that necrotizing fasciitis should be differentiated during postmortem diagnosis, especially in cases showing lower extremity edema with early putrefactive changes. In addition, forensic pathologists should closely examine a lower extremity of such cases to detect a true cause of death, even if other pathological findings which can be a cause of death, such as pneumonia and dehydration, are observed in major internal organs.

However, it is not certain whether unexpected death of the homeless have actually decreased in proportion to decrease in total number of cases. Methods: The documentation of medicolegal deaths among homeless persons handled in the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office during 1999-2010 were reviewed, and we compared the number and manner/cause of death between cases occurring before 2004 and those occurring after 2004. In addition, we compared manner/cause of death between homeless and non-homeless persons. Results: The number of medicolegal deaths of homeless persons remained almost the same during the study period in spite of a marked decrease in the total number of homeless persons after 2004. Age distribution shifted to older after 2004, and a higher proportion of the deceased had longer postmortem periods after 2004. Comparison between the manners/causes of death of the cases occurring before 2004 and those occurring after 2004 showed little difference. Disease constituted about 70% of all cases, and causes of death from disease were more various than those of non-homeless persons. Certain specific patterns included a higher proporton of death from circulatory disease in elderly homeless persons and a higher proportion of death from alcohol-related digestive disease and tuberculosis among younger homeless persons. Regarding accidental death, hypothermia was a leading cause of death irrespective of age group. Conclusion: Aging and isolation among homeless persons might contribute to an unchanged number of medicolegal death of them. In addition to measures to address frequent causes of death in each age group, better intervention for isolated homeless persons might be a key factor to prevent unexpected deaths of homeless persons in the future.

Methods The study is a retrospective review of the log of patients referred to the liaison psychiatry team at an Inner-City Dublin hospital from the ED or inpatients wards where self-harm was the reason for admission. Three time frames were chosen between January and June 2020: a baseline group (T1), lockdown (T2) and re-opening of society (T3). Severity of presentation was measured using the Threshold Assessment Grid (TAG) (n=306)[1]. Data were analysed using the application SPSS. Results There was a significant increase in self-harm presentations in T2 and T3 (T2 - 55.1% n=27 & T3 - 38.1% n=16) with the highest incidence during the first lockdown (T2), and this was statistically significant (p=0.029). Psychiatric admissions rose during the pandemic, highest in T3 with an admission rate of 26.8% (n=11) compared to baseline (19.9%, n=39 T1, p value 0.733). Substance misuse levels were high among this population, the baseline group level of substance misuse was 57.7% (n=113) and this rose to 71.4% (n=35) and 80% (n=32) in T2 and T3 respectively (p=0.008). The study found that the homeless represent 37% (n=107) of the population seen in the ED by psychiatry (0.92% of local population). This number rose during periods of lockdown and during the reopening of society to 46.9% (n=23, T2) and 47.5% (n=19, T3) respectively. Conclusions The preliminary data suggests further research is warranted to fully understand and address the impact on this population however it is clear that there is a need to strengthen and expand current mental health systems to address the ongoing mental health crisis. Through this research we demonstrated the feasibility of doing a larger and more conclusive study with the current proposed methodology.","L639200463     2022-10-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Use (Psychiatric) | USER-NOTES: {""Carolyn""=>["" The study found that the homeless represent 37% (n=107) of the population seen in the ED by psychiatry (0.92% of local population).

Many PWID are unaware of their infection and few have received HCV treatment. Recent developments in treatment offer cure rates >90%. However, the potential of these treatments will only be realised if HCV identification among PWID with linkage to treatment is optimised. This paper describes the Hepcare Europe project, a collaboration between five institutions across four member states (Ireland, UK, Spain, Romania), to develop, implement and evaluate interventions to improve the identification, evaluation and treatment of HCV among PWID. METHODS: A service innovation project and a mixed-methods, pre-post intervention study, Hepcare will design and deliver interventions in Dublin, London, Seville and Bucharest to enhance PWID engagement and retention in the cascade of HCV care. RESULTS: The feasibility, acceptability, potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these interventions to improve care processes and outcomes among PWID will be evaluated. CONCLUSION: Hepcare has the potential to make an important impact on patient care for marginalised populations who might otherwise go undiagnosed and untreated.

The mobile health clinic (MHC), staffed by trainee general practitioners, targets and provides homeless people in Dublin with free and easy access to primary healthcare services. AIMS: To explore and determine the specific health reasons for attending the mobile health unit and to investigate whether the MHC improves access to primary healthcare for homeless people. METHODS: Interviewer-administered questionnaire addressed demographic characteristics, physical and mental health status. RESULTS: Forty-two participants were recruited in this study. The majority were male (90%), single (74%), Irish (81%) and in the 25-44 age group (71%). Risky health behaviour was common: tobacco use (93%; 39/42), illicit drug use (60%; 25/42) and alcohol use (45%; 19/42). Most participants described their health status as fair (48%) or good (31%). There were high rates of physical and mental health conditions. Hepatitis C (29%; 12/42) and depression (43%; 18/42) were prevalent. Dental disease was present in 79%. Compared with MHC, most health conditions were diagnosed and treated at other healthcare facility (OHF) [134 vs 27]. Report of physical health symptoms, such as coughs (61%) and migraine headache (46%), was also high, an average of five per person/year. CONCLUSION: While the findings of this study are limited by the small sample size, they nevertheless indicate that the MHC promotes access to primary care service. Results also highlight the need to expand the healthcare approaches on the MHC to adequately meet the health needs of its target population.","1863-4362     Swabri, Jahbyn     Uzor, Chiadika     Orcid: 0000-0002-9202-2332     Laird, Eamon     O'Carroll, Austin     Journal Article     Ireland     Ir J Med Sci. 2019 May;188(2):545-554. doi: 10.1007/s11845-018-1892-0.

Terplan, Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States","Aims: Historically, substance abuse (SA) has been considered a problem of young people, especially men. Hence less is known about the nature of SA in older women. The number of baby boomers in the US suggests that as this cohort ages, there will be an increased need for services specific to older women. Methods: Data were drawn from the Treatment Episode Data Set-Discharges (TEDS-D). Analysis compared women under 50 (n = 1,878,067) to those 50 and over (N= 182,246) via multivariable logistic regression. Characteristics included were race/ethnicity, education, source of income, living arrangements, primary substance, age at first use, days awaiting treatment, referral source, number of substances, treatment setting, and prior episodes. Results: In demographic comparisons, older women were more likely to be black (OR = 2.57 [2.52, 2.66]), divorced/widowed (OR = 1.39 [1.35,1.42]), high school graduates (OR = 1.43 [1.39, 1.47]), homeless (OR = 1.32 [1.25, 1.34]), receiving retirement or disability income (OR = 3.40 [3.29, 3.51]), and to have started use of their primary drug as adults (OR 2.21 [2.17, 2.27]). Older women were also more likely to have prior treatment episodes and be enrolled for alcohol, which may explain many of the treatment characteristics observed. Specifically, older women were more likely than younger women to go into detoxification and have short wait times, and less likely to have criminal justice referrals (OR = 0.87 [0.84, 0.88]). Conclusions: These findings suggest there are differences between older and younger women in treatment. These may be the result of cohort effects or evidence of changes in SA as women age. There is need to further investigate the factors driving these differences to better inform healthcare policies and treatment services for this population.","L71802224     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.686,alcohol;substance abuse;United States;college;drug dependence;female;human;income;baby boomer;education;male;logistic regression analysis;detoxification;epidemiology;population;high school graduate;adult;disability;criminal justice;retirement;health care policy;Substance-Related Disorders,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Tielen, Stichting Prisma, Biezenmortel, Netherlands","In the palliative care for people with intellectual disabilities (ID) the same moral issues are present as in the normal population. The particular nature of this care form causes the usual protocols and guidelines for these issues to be virtually unusable and usual care to be highly unpredictable Especially the position of the client is ill-represented This means that caregivers are required to use their personal moral judgments. Often the answer to the question why they make choices in care is â€œjust because it feels goodâ€. Using three case studies, the process of forming daily moral considerations is shown The study is designed from an ethics of care perspective that offers the possibility to focus on the interrelational character of the care, attention for the context of care and the possibility to ask the question to what good living in a palliative care phase entails. Three cases were selected from patients admitted to a hospice for people with ID in The Netherlands, and analysed retrospectively The first case is of a homeless man of 67 with a mild ID, who's lifestyle was incompatible with the institutional boundaries of the hospice. The second case is of a 50-yearold man with severe intellectual and physical disabilities showing extremely problematic behaviour. The last case is of a 33-year-old woman with a mild ID, who confronted the hospice staff with her personal wishes that caused moral conflicts within the staff members Development of moral sensitivity of staff members of palliative care facilities for people with ID deserves attention This will form an important source of moral wealth in the development of excellent palliative care for people with ID.","L614041165     2017-01-17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1177/0269216316646056,adult;attention;ethics;female;homeless man;hospice;human;intellectual impairment;lifestyle;major clinical study;male;morality;Netherlands;palliative therapy;physical disability;problem behavior;staff;Intellectual Disability;Palliative Care,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: A 28-item, quantitative and qualitative semistructured survey was administered to 71 patients enrolled in a public sector, office-based buprenorphine program between June and September 2013. Survey domains included: demographic characteristics, mobile phone and TM use patterns, and mobile phone and TM use patterns and preferences pertaining to their substance treatment. Results: Mobile phone ownership was common (93%) with no significant differences in ownership among self-reported homeless, recently incarcerated, and unemployed respondents. Most reported sending or receiving TM (93%) and reporting 'very much' or 'somewhat' comfort sending TM (79%). Contacting buprenorphine providers by phone (30%) or TM (17%) was uncommon, however most preferred to use either form of communication to reach their provider (67%). Older patients received less TM (25) compared to younger age groups (128) yet were as interested as the rest of the clinic population to have their provider's mobile phone number (96%) and send TM if at risk of relapse (78%). Conclusions: Our findings highlight the acceptability of enhancing patient-provider mobile phone and TM communications in a public sector, office-based buprenorphine clinic, even among respondents that were not comfortable in using TM. Although mobile phone ownership was very common, frequent turnover in phone ownership and changing phone numbers highlights challenges in feasibility for any future m health interventions in this clinical setting.","L71801926     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.694,buprenorphine;mobile phone;text messaging;organization and management;college;drug dependence;human;patient;hospital;interpersonal communication;demography;health;relapse;risk;population;groups by age;comfort;turnover rate;unemployment;Buprenorphine;Cellular Phone,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This study compares syringe disposal practices in a U.S. city with NSPs to a U.S. city without NSPs by examining the prevalence of improperly discarded syringes in public places and the self-reported syringe disposal practices of injection drug users (IDUs) in the two cities. Methods: We conducted visual inspection walkthroughs in a random sample of the top-quartile of drug-affected neighborhoods in San Francisco, California (a city with NSPs) and Miami, Florida (a city without NSPs). We also conducted quantitative interviews with adult IDUs in San Francisco (N= 602) and Miami (N= 448). Results: In the visual inspections, we found 44 syringes/1000 census blocks in San Francisco, and 371 syringes/1000 census blocks in Miami. Survey results showed that in San Francisco 13% of syringes IDUs reported using in the 30 days preceding the study interviews were disposed of improperly versus 95% of syringes by IDUs in Miami. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, IDUs in Miami had over 34 times the adjusted odds of public syringe disposal relative to IDUs in San Francisco (adjusted odds ratio = 34.2, 95% CI = 21.92, 53.47). Conclusions: We found eight-fold more improperly disposed syringes on walkthroughs in the city without NSPs compared to the city with NSPs, which was corroborated by survey data.

Few studies investigating psychiatric patients' Internet use exist. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the number of psychiatric patients that use the Internet in comparison to the general population. Since patients with mental health disorders frequently suffer from a variety of disadvantages in society, it was evaluated whether psychiatric patients were disadvantaged particularly concerning the use and access of the Internet. Three hundred and thirty-seven patients participated in the study and completed a 29-item questionnaire. A response rate of 66% was achieved. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance and binary logistic regression analysis were used. Out of the participants, 79.5% were Internet users. This number corresponds to the Internet use of the general population. Young patients in particular were found to use online information, using mostly search engines to seek medical information. The results show that psychiatric patients do not rank below the general population concerning the frequency of Internet use, which is especially important for accessing health related information online or participating in online programs.

Participantsâ€™ perceptions and knowledge about ECT were assessed before and after watching a psychoeducational video about ECT. Participants showed significant increases in positive perceptions and accurate knowledge about ECT after watching the psychoeducational video. In the perception domain, the items â€œECT can be lifesavingâ€ and â€œfears that ECT can be painfulâ€ showed the largest positive increases. In the knowledge domain, items related to â€œECT is one of the safest procedures performedâ€ and â€œECT can be given safely to older personsâ€ showed the largest increases. Over 20% of participants changed their mind and reported they were willing to try ECT after watching the video.

Participants in SR and NSR programs were compared on their ratings of the social climate of the program, and housing and psychosocial outcomes. Results: Participants in SR programs reported more days housed and better psychosocial outcomes than participants in NSR programs, although the differences were small and there were no differences in ratings of their social climate. Both participants in SR and NSR programs showed improvements on most outcomes after discharge from transitional housing. There were no significant differences in outcomes between participants actively abusing substances at program entry compared to those who were not.

Methods: Pilot randomized controlled trial of adult patients with OUD initiating buprenorphine treatment (n = 78) at two sites (Seattle, WA and Boston, MA) from January 2019 to May 2020. Intervention was video DOT using a HIPAA-compliant smartphone application to record taking daily buprenorphine. Study smartphones, text reminders to upload a video, and calendar summaries of video DOT adherence were provided. Main outcomes were 1) percentage of 12 weekly urine drug tests (UDT) negative for illicit opioids and 2) engagement in treatment at week 12 (i.e., having an active prescription for buprenorphine within the last 7 days). Results: Of 78 enrolled, 20 (26 %) were female; 29 (37 %) non-white; and 31 (40 %) homeless. The mean (standard deviation) percentage of doses confirmed by video was 31 % (34 %). In intention-to-treat analysis, the average percentage of weekly opioid negative UDT was 50 % (95 % CI: 40â€“63 %) in the intervention arm versus 64 % (95 % CI: 55â€“74 %) among controls; RR = 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.60â€“1.02, p = 0.07). Engagement at week 12 was 69 % (95 % CI: 56â€“86 %) v. 82 % (95 % CI: 71â€“95 %) in the intervention vs. TAU arms, respectively; RR = 0.84 (95 % CI: 0.65â€“1.10, p = 0.20). Conclusions: The video DOT intervention did not result in improvements in illicit opioid use and treatment engagement compared to TAU. The study was limited by low rates of intervention use.

Tucker, BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, St Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Aims: We examine the prevalence of and risk factors associated with injection of methadone in an urban population. Methods: Between December, 2005 and November, 2013, data were derived from two open prospective studies of persons who inject drugs (PWID) in Vancouver, Canada. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression was used to determine factors independently associated with illicit methadone injecting. Results: Over the study period, 1911 individuals were recruited, including 34% women. Of these, 134 (7%) participants reported methadone injecting at least once. In the multivariable analysis, Caucasian ethnicity [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-3.00]; homelessness (AOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.12-1.99); drug dealing (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.53-2.98); â‰¥daily heroin injection (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.10-2.29); â‰¥daily crack smoking (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.44-2.94); and being a victim of violence (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.08-2.20) were independently and positively associated with methadone injection. Conversely, female gender (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.30-0.77) was negatively associated with methadone injecting. Conclusions: Diversion of methadone for illicit injection was prevalent in this urban setting and was associated with several markers of addiction severity and other health and social vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the need to ensure methadone accessibility while limiting diversion-related risk.","L72176985     2016-02-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.07.607,methadone;diamorphine;marker;Canadian;college;drug dependence;human;injection;female;risk;prevalence;ethnicity;Caucasian;urban population;logistic regression analysis;gender;health;risk factor;violence;smoking;confidence interval;homelessness;Canada;victim;prospective study;addiction;Methadone,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: A probability sample of 292 homeless youth smokers in Los Angeles County completed a self-administered survey, and a separate convenience sample of 27 homeless youth who were lifetime smokers participated in focus groups. Survey participants reported on background characteristics, smoking cognitions, and high-risk smoking practices. Focus group participants described how they obtained cigarettes and responses relevant to sniping were coded. Results: Survey results indicated that nearly all youth engaged in at least one high-risk smoking practice, with three-quarters having sniped cigarettes in the past 30 days. Sniping was more frequent among youth with less negative smoking attitudes (b = 0.29,95% CI= 0.55 to 0.04, p = 0.02), greater nicotine dependence (b = 0.11, 95% CI= 0.00 to 0.23, p = 0.046), lower income (b = 0.05, 95% CI=-0.09 to 0.01, p = 0.02), and more severe drug abuse (b = 0.15, 95% Cl = 0.04, 0.26, p = 0.01). Focus groups data indicated that youth snipe because it provides cheap and easy access to tobacco, and use specific strategies to mitigate the perceived health risks of sniping. Conclusions: Sniping and other high-risk smoking practices deserve further attention among homeless youth, particularly those already facing greater health threats due to factors such as nicotine dependence, lower income, and drug abuse. 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Tucker, RAND Corporation, 1776 Main Street, PO Box 2138, Santa Monica, CA, United States","Introduction: Roll-your-own (RYO) cigarette smoking is uncommon among young smokers in the U.S. but may be more widespread among those experiencing homelessness as it is a less expensive source of cigarettes. This study examines the prevalence and correlates of RYO use among young cigarette smokers experiencing homelessness. Methods: The analytic sample consisted of 433 unaccompanied homeless youth who reported past month use of factory-manufactured cigarettes. Participants were sampled from 25 street and service sites in Los Angeles County, and completed a survey on their tobacco-related behaviors and cognitions. Results: RYO use was reported by 43% of cigarette smokers. Among those who filled RYOs with tobacco, 87% rolled them with used tobacco (typically mixed with new tobacco). Most RYO smokers reported engaging in high-risk smoking practices, such as smoking discarded cigarettes. Although RYO smokers were more likely than other smokers to perceive RYOs as less risky in general, these groups did not differ in the perceived relative harm, expense, and ease of access of RYOs compared to regular cigarettes. Multivariable analyses indicated that RYO use was associated with older age, less perceived riskiness of RYOs, greater exposure to RYO smokers, and stronger future intentions to smoke. Conclusion: RYOs may encourage continued tobacco use among youth experiencing homelessness and pose additional health risks despite usersâ€™ beliefs to the contrary. Future research is needed to obtain more detailed information on RYO practices and motivations for use, as well as how to address RYOs in efforts to reduce tobacco use in this population.","L2003583443     2019-11-04 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107632,age;aged;article;California;cigarette smoking;cognition;controlled study;health hazard;homeless youth;homelessness;human;human tissue;motivation;prevalence;smoking;tobacco;Smoke;Adolescent;Smoking,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This study addresses a significant gap in the literature by examining the prevalence and correlates of tobacco and marijuana co-use among young people experiencing homelessness. Methods: The analytic sample consisted of 449 unaccompanied homeless youth (mean age = 22; 72% male) who had used any type of tobacco product in the past 30 days. Participants were recruited from 12 service sites and 13 street sites in Los Angeles County. Results: Over 90% of young homeless tobacco users reported past month marijuana and tobacco co-use: 65% reported any co-administration (mixing both substances in a cigarette, joint, blunt, bong, hookah, pipe or bowl) and 27% reported only using them separately. Analysis of covariance tests found that co-administrators reported greater quantity and frequency of tobacco cigarette use, more frequent marijuana use and, in some cases, poorer functioning and more severe homelessness compared to other tobacco users (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that co-administration was less likely among youth who were Black (vs. white) and who perceived it as being the same or more harmful than cigarette smoking, but more likely among youth who reported greater exposure to peers who engaged in co-administration (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Co-administration of tobacco and marijuana is prevalent among young tobacco users experiencing homelessness. Results add to a growing literature on the prevalence and potential risks of co-administration among young people that can inform policies aimed at regulating tobacco and marijuana products.","L2004240640     2019-12-30     2020-01-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107809,cannabis;adult;article;Black person;cannabis use;Caucasian;controlled study;criminal behavior;female;homelessness;human;male;prevalence;priority journal;race difference;recreation;smoking cessation;smoking regulation;tobacco use;United States;young adult;Cannabis;Los Angeles,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Cross-sectional study of 4,386 acute psychiatric admissions discharged from a single NHS Trust in 2008-2009. Homelessness occurred in 16%. Most homelessness (70%) was either recorded as present at admission or started within 1 week. It was associated with younger age; male gender; ethnicity other than White British or Black African/Caribbean; being single, divorced, separated or widowed; diagnosis of drug and alcohol disorder; detention under a forensic section of the Mental Health Act; having no previous admission or alternatively having a longer previous admission; having a low score on the depressed mood or hallucinations and delusions items of the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS); and having a high score on the HoNOS relationship difficulties and occupation and activities items. Of those who were followed-up for 28 days after discharge, 53% had a new address recorded; of those who were not, only 22% did. Homelessness affects a substantial minority of psychiatric admissions in the UK. Housing outcomes are uncertain, and it is possible that more than half continue to be homeless or living in very transient situations. Demographic and diagnostic associations with homelessness were consistent with US studies; associations with HoNOS item scores and having had no admission in the preceding 2 years suggest that, in many cases, social adversity predominates over active psychopathology at the time of admission.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 14 Total Times Cited: 14 Cited Reference Count: 38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s00127-011-0414-4,Mental disorder;Homeless persons;Hospitals;Psychiatric;Residential mobility;HEALTH-SERVICE USE;RISK-FACTORS;PAST HOMELESSNESS;SCALES HONOS;MEN;VARIABLES;LONDON;Prevalence,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Although need for housing has often been identified as a cause of delayed discharge, there has been little research into the associations between LOS and homelessness and residential mobility (moving to a new home), or the magnitude of these associations compared to other exposures. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 4885 acute psychiatric admissions to a mental health NHS Trust serving four South London boroughs. Data were taken from a comprehensive repository of anonymised electronic patient records. Analysis was performed using log-linear regression. Results: Residential mobility was associated with a 99% increase in LOS and homelessness with a 45% increase. Schizophrenia, other psychosis, the longest recent admission, residential mobility, and some items on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS), especially ADL impairment, were also associated with increased LOS. Informal admission, drug and alcohol or other non-psychotic diagnosis and a high HoNOS self-harm score reduced LOS. Including residential mobility in the regression model produced the same increase in the variance explained as including diagnosis; only legal status was a stronger predictor. Conclusions: Homelessness and, especially, residential mobility account for a significant part of variation in LOS despite affecting a minority of psychiatric inpatients; for these people, the effect on LOS is marked. Appropriate policy responses may include attempts to avert the loss of housing in association with admission, efforts to increase housing supply and the speed at which it is made available, and reforms of payment systems to encourage this.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 28 Total Times Cited: 28 Cited Reference Count: 68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/1471-244X-12-121,Length of stay;Hospitals psychiatric;Mental disorders;Residential mobility;Homeless persons;SEVERE MENTAL-ILLNESS;ACUTE INPATIENT CARE;LONG-STAY;HOSPITAL PAYMENT;UNITED-STATES;HEALTH;INDIVIDUALS;DISORDERS;SERVICE;SYSTEM;Length of Stay;Population Dynamics,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Tweed, MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom","Background People with a history of homelessness, imprisonment, substance use, sex work, or serious mental illness experience much higher rates of ill-health and premature death than the general population. There is substantial overlap in these experiences in the population, and they may interact in important ways to influence health. However, the health outcomes associated with these experiences in combination have not previously been reviewed. We therefore aimed to synthesise existing evidence on allcause mortality; cause-specific mortality; morbidity from conditions appearing in ICD-10; self-rated health; and quality of life among people with lifetime exposure to more than one of the following: homelessness; imprisonment; substance use; sex work; or serious mental illness. Methods We searched Medline, Embase, and Psycinfo using search terms for the above exposures and outcomes, in consultation with a medical librarian. Eligible studies comprised peer-reviewed English-language articles from high-income countries published since 1998 reporting at least one relevant outcome for people with lifetime exposure to two or more exposures of interest, in comparison to people with one or no exposures. Screening was undertaken independently by two authors using Covidence, with risk of bias assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Findings were summarised using a pre-specified narrative synthesis plan. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018097189). Results Searches retrieved 15,948 unique citations. After full text screening of 1,583 studies, initial results from 293 studies for which data extraction has been completed are presented here. Of these, 73% were cross-sectional studies. The most common exposure combinations were imprisonment & substance use (33%) and serious mental illness & substance use (26%); only 11 data points (1%) reported outcomes associated with >2 exposures. Infectious diseases were by far the most common outcomes studied (44%): blood-borne viruses alone accounted for 33% of all data points. The next most common outcomes were external causes, injury, and poisoning (16%) and mental disorders (14%): together with infections, these categories accounted for 73% of all data points. Conclusion Existing research on the health of people experiencing multiple forms of social exclusion is dominated by cross-sectional studies examining a relatively limited set of exposures and outcomes. The lack of data on more than two exposures in combination; self-rated health or quality of life; or non-communicable diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease and cancer) suggests that research to date may not reflect the true burden of ill-health in these populations. Limitations include restriction to peer-reviewed studies and risk of publication bias.","L638508602     2022-07-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1136/jech-2019-SSMabstracts.43,cardiovascular disease;conference abstract;consultation;controlled study;cross-sectional study;data extraction;Embase;English (language);high income country;homelessness;human;ICD-10;imprisonment;intoxication;librarian;Medline;mental disease;morbidity;mortality;narrative;Newcastle-Ottawa scale;non communicable disease;nonhuman;outcome assessment;PsycINFO;publication bias;quality of life;risk assessment;social exclusion;substance use;synthesis;systematic review;virus,,,N,N,Full text screen

DESIGN: A nationally representative telephone survey using trained bilingual interviewers and computer-assisted telephone interview software. SETTING: The study was conducted in France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: European adult citizens, selected from opt-in panels from March to December 2017. Total desired sample size was 5600, with 700 per country. Expected response rates of approximately 30% led to initial sample sizes of 2500 per country. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: History of homelessness was assessed for lifetime, past 5 years and past year. Sociodemographic data were collected to assess correlates of homelessness prevalence using generalised linear models for clustered and weighted samples. RESULTS: Response rates ranged from 30.4% to 33.5% (n=5631). Homelessness prevalence was 4.96% for lifetime (95% CI 4.39% to 5.59%), 1.92% in the past 5 years (95% CI 1.57% to 2.33%) and 0.71% for the past year (95% CI 0.51% to 0.98%) and varied significantly between countries (pairwise comparison difference test, p<0.0001). Time spent homeless ranged between less than a week (21%) and more than a year (18%), with high contrasts between countries (p<0.0001). Male gender, age 45-54, lower secondary education, single status, unemployment and an urban environment were all independently strongly associated with lifetime homelessness (all OR >1.5). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of homelessness among the surveyed nations is significantly higher than might be expected from point-in-time and homeless service use statistics. There was substantial variation in estimated prevalence across the eight nations.

However, large-scale long-term studies of buprenorphine abuse are lacking. The objective of this study was to examine the trend in characteristics of clients seeking treatment for buprenorphine abuse and compare them to those seeking treatment for heroin and amphetamine abuse. Methods: A 12-year descriptive study was conducted at the Helsinki Deaconess Institute (HDI), a public utility foundation responsible for providing treatment for substance abuse in the greater Helsinki area. All clients seeking treatment between 31 January 1997 and 31 August 2008 received a structured clinical interview concerning demographic characteristics and abuse patterns. Characteristics of clients who reported that their primary drug of abuse was buprenorphine (n= 780) were compared to those whose primary drug of abuse was either heroin (n= 598) or amphetamine (n= 1249). Results: The annual proportion of buprenorphine clients increased from 3.0% in 1998 to 38.4% in 2008. Daily abuse (73.8%) and intravenous administration (80.6%) were common among buprenorphine clients. Concurrent abuse of prescription medications (p< 0.001), stimulants (p= 0.001) and alcohol (p< 0.001) increased from 1997 to 2008. Treatment seeking for heroin abuse declined to approximately 1% of clients annually after 2002. Buprenorphine clients were more likely to be daily users of their primary drug (p< 0.001), abuse prescription medications (p< 0.001) and administer drugs intravenously (p= 0.001 from 1997 to 2001) compared to heroin and amphetamine clients. Conclusions: Our results highlight the increasing abuse of buprenorphine in Finland. Buprenorphine clients had risky abuse patterns in terms of daily use and intravenous administration. Concurrent substance abuse increased during the study period.

Vaish, TSCUH, Dublin, Ireland","Background: Improvements in medical care have resulted in increasing numbers of children with complex care needs. These patients have substantial care needs resulting in functional limitations that may require tailored technological assistance (Cohen et al. 2011). These increased medical needs can result in prolonged hospital stay with a significant impact on the lives of the patient and their family. Discharge planning is an important aspect of patient care and can be challenging to organize for these patients. Currently there is a lot of disparity in the co-ordination of discharge or transfer process for these patients throughout our hospital. The has had a negative impact, some of which include, a delay in recognizing these patients and their needs, poor communication between health care professions, duplication of work and poor patient experience. Aims: A pilot QI initiative to improve the discharge planning process for long stay children with complex care needs by decreasing the time to initiate the discharge planning from more than 100 days to less than 60 days of in-patient stay on a ward at Temple Street Children's University Hospital, Dublin. Methods: Baseline data was collected and analysed to establish the median number of days before discharge planning was initiated for five children with complex care needs who were long-stay in-patients (i.e. for more than 30 days) on a particular ward at TSCUH. A patient-centred approach to improving inpatient discharge planning process for long-stay patients with complex care needs was created. A number of plan, do, study and act (PDSA) cycles were conducted in developing a baseline data collection method and a criteria based referral pathway to allow for initiation of a standardised discharge process for these patients. Early recognition of these patients assessed the impact on initiating the discharge planning process for patients admitted to one of the wards at TSCUH.

This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the role of SEM in both fatal and non-fatal overdose among people who use opioids. Methods: Studies published between January 1, 2000 and March 31, 2018 were identified through searching electronic databases, citations, and by contacting experts. The titles, abstracts, citation information, and descriptor terms of citations were screened by two team members. Data were synthesized using the lumping technique. Results: A total of 37 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review, with 34 of 37 finding a significant association between at least one socioeconomic factor and overdose. The included studies contained variables related to eight socioeconomic factors: criminal justice system involvement, income, employment, social support, health insurance, housing/homelessness, education, and composite measures of socio-economic status. Most studies found associations in the hypothesized direction, whereby increased SEM was associated with a higher rate or increased likelihood of the overdose outcome measured. The review revealed an underdeveloped evidence base. Conclusions: Nearly all reviewed studies found a connection between a socioeconomic variable and overdose, but more research is needed with an explicit focus on SEM, using robust and nuanced measures that capture multiple dimensions of disadvantage, and collect data over time to better inform decision making around opioid overdose.","L2006962811     2020-07-16     2020-07-20 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Systematic Review (studies included individually)",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108127,"citation analysis;criminal justice;drug overdose;economic status;educational status;employment;evidence based medicine;health insurance;homelessness;housing;human;income;opiate addiction;outcome assessment;priority journal;review;risk factor;social exclusion;social status;social support;systematic review;Analgesics, Opioid",,,N,N,Full text screen

Aims: The primary aim was to describe the prevalence of FAs at an inner city ED. A subgroup analysis was undertaken for high and very high FAs to establish demographics and other factors which might cause them to attend frequently. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients who attended the ED at Mercy University Hospital (MUH), Cork, during 2016 was undertaken. Patients were classified as either infrequent attenders (1â€“2 attendances/year), frequent attenders (3â€“12 attendances/year), high frequent attenders (HFA, 13â€“29 attendances/year), or very high frequent attenders (VHFA, > 30 attendances/year). Results: During 2016, a total of 21,920 patients presented 33,152 times. Overall, 90.2% (n = 19,761) were infrequent attenders, whilst 9.6% (n = 2115) were FAs. A further 36 patients (0.16%) were HFAs and eight patients (0.04%) were classified as VHFAs. Almost 10% of patients attended the ED three or more times, accounting for 29% of overall ED attendances. The HFA and VHFA cohorts were predominantly male (79.5%, n = 35) with an average age of 49.6Â years. They were found to have multiple medical comorbidities, complex psychosocial problems, and a mortality rate of 11.3% over a 2-year period. Conclusions: This retrospective review is the most detailed assessment of Irish FAs undertaken to date. Further studies are required to examine the Irish hospitals most at need of Case Management Strategy Programmes which we postulate could minimise the risk of adverse outcomes for these patients and improve overall ED efficiency.

C. and Bingham, T.",,eng,,"School of Health Sciences, Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland. mcvanhout@wit.ie","BACKGROUND: Mephedrone injecting has recently been reported in Romania, Slovenia, Guernsey and Ireland. The research reported here aimed to describe the experiences of a group of Irish injecting drug users, who were injecting mephedrone based headshop products prior to the introduction of legislative controls in Ireland, with particular focus on pre- and post-legislative use, effects of injecting mephedrone, settings and contexts for injecting, polydrug use and serial drug injecting, risk perceptions and harm reduction practises. METHODS: Following a predevelopment phase with a Privileged Access Interviewer, in-depth interviews using a phenomenological approach were conducted with eleven attendees of a low threshold harm reduction service. RESULTS: The findings describe the abuse potential of these mephedrone based headshop products when used by intravenous injection. Although participants were aware of risks and safe injecting practises, compulsive re injecting with excessive binge use over long periods of time was common. Nasal to injection route transitions, intense paranoia, violent behaviour and aggression, emergence of Parkinson type symptomatologies (in the form of spasms and 'wobbling'), and permanent numbness in lower extremities were reported. Multi and serial drug injecting with heroin was used in efforts to manage the intense rush and avoid unpleasant comedown. Participants reported limb abscesses, vein clotting, damage and recession resulting from product toxicity, crystallisation of the products when diluted and flushing practises. Seven participants were homeless, with groin and street injecting common. Following legislative changes use of mephedrone products declined due to closure of headshops, increased street prices, concerns around contamination and the emergence of new street stimulant drugs. CONCLUSION: Continued monitoring of drug displacement patterns in post legislative time frames is advised, alongside longitudinal ethnographic research to track the diffusion of mephedrone and other cathinone derivatives within injecting networks. Further investigation of the adverse health consequences of these drugs on injection is warranted.","1873-4758     Van Hout, Marie Claire     Bingham, Tim     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Netherlands     Int J Drug Policy. 2012 May;23(3):188-97. doi: 10.1016/j.drugpo.2012.01.008.

Substance Misuse Programme, Irish College of General Practitioners, Dublin, Ireland.","BACKGROUND: Treatment for opioid dependence in Ireland is provided predominantly by general practitioners (GP) who have undergone additional training in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) and substance misuse. The National Methadone Treatment Programme (MTP) was introduced in 1998, and was designed to treat the opioid dependent population and to regulate the prescribing regimes at the time. The past two decades have seen the increased prescribing of methadone in primary care and changes in type of opioid abused, in particular, the increased use of over the counter (OTC) and prescription medications. Despite the scaling up of OAT in Ireland, drug related deaths however have increased and waiting lists for treatment exist in some areas outside the capital, Dublin. Two previous MTP reviews have made recommendations aimed at improving and scaling up of OAT in Ireland. This study updates these recommendations and is the first time that a group of national experts have engaged in structured research to identify barriers to OAT delivery in Ireland. The aim was to explore the views of national statutory and non-statutory stakeholders and experts on current barriers within the MTP and broader OAT delivery structures in order to inform their future design and implementation. METHODS: A single focus group with a chosen group of national key stakeholders and experts with a broad range of expertise (clinical, addiction and social inclusion management, harm reduction, homelessness, specialist GPs, academics) (nâ€‰=â€‰11) was conducted. The group included national representation from the areas of drug treatment delivery, service design, policy and practice in Ireland. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the narrative analysis, and centred on OAT Choices and Patient Characteristics; Systemic Barriers to Optimal OAT Service Provision; GP Training and Registration in the MTP, and Solutions and Models of Good Practice: Using What You Have. CONCLUSION: The study identified a series of improvement strategies which could reduce barriers to access and the stigma associated with OAT, optimise therapeutic choices, enhance interagency care planning within the MTP, utilise the strengths of community pharmacy and nurse prescribers, and recruit and support methadone prescribing GPs in Ireland.","1471-2296     Van Hout, Marie Claire     Orcid: 0000-0002-0018-4060     Crowley, Des     McBride, Aoife     Delargy, Ide     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     BMC Fam Pract. 2018 Jun 30;19(1):103. doi: 10.1186/s12875-018-0792-8. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Health care - Quality (Addiction)",10.1186/s12875-018-0792-8,"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use;Focus Groups;General Practitioners;Humans;Ireland;Methadone/therapeutic use;Opiate Substitution Treatment/*methods;Opioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy;Primary Health Care/*methods;Quality Improvement;Stakeholder Participation;General practitioner (GP);Methadone treatment Programme;Opioid agonist treatment (OAT);Opioid dependence;the Public Health Institute of Liverpool John Moores University, United Kingdom.;She also holds the Clinical Audit Facilitator role at the Irish College of;General Practitioners, Ireland.

Still there is room for improvement, for example to smoothen the cooperation in the homecare and hospital care and to improve the quality of education about palliative care for professionals. The government formulated 13 goals in the national programme (NPPZ) in 2020 and will invest 51 million euro for the improvements (2014-2020). ZonMw (as a governmental funding agency) is asked to formulate a programme to be able to subsidise projects, organised in four themes: - awareness and culture - organisation and continuity of care - innovations and quality of care - patient involvement and support. The patient has a central role in the programme, called Palliantie. In the presentation I will explain what the purpose of the government is, which role the regional palliative care plays in this field and how we stimulate new developments and improvements in research, care and education. The organisations involved in palliative care work together in seven regional networks. In the start of this programme we talked to 125 experts about difficulties within the four themes and for different targetgroups in palliative care like children, people with dementia or homeless or psychiatric people. They gave their priorities for important improvements in the palliative care. We will ask them again in 2016 and in 2018 to actualise the priorities. Researchers, education experts and/or carers are invited every year to send in proposals to improve palliative care. In the presentation I will tell more about the differences in priorities by several targetgroups, about the four themes and goals in these themes, the role of the patients in the programme and projects and the impact of the investment we want to achieve in 2020. In a free communication session I'd like to discuss the differences between countries, which are present in the workshop, the difficulties in improvement of palliative care and possible solutions.","L614041486     2017-01-17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1177/0269216316646056,awareness;child;clinical study;dementia;education;funding;government;home care;human;investment;Netherlands;organization;palliative therapy;patient care;patient participation;scientist;Palliative Care,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Tobacco-caused conditions are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among people experiencing homelessness, highlighting an urgent need for interventions to reduce the burden of tobacco use in this population. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether interventions designed to improve access to tobacco cessation interventions for adults experiencing homelessness lead to increased numbers engaging in or receiving treatment, and whether interventions designed to help adults experiencing homelessness to quit tobacco lead to increased tobacco abstinence. To also assess whether tobacco cessation interventions for adults experiencing homelessness affect substance use and mental health. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO for studies using the terms: un-housed*, homeless*, housing instability, smoking cessation, tobacco use disorder, smokeless tobacco. We also searched trial registries to identify unpublished studies. Date of the most recent search: 06 January 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials that recruited people experiencing homelessness who used tobacco, and investigated interventions focused on the following: 1) improving access to relevant support services; 2) increasing motivation to quit tobacco use; 3) helping people to achieve abstinence, including but not limited to behavioral support, tobacco cessation pharmacotherapies, contingency management, and text- or app-based interventions; or 4) encouraging transitions to long-term nicotine use that did not involve tobacco. Eligible comparators included no intervention, usual care (as defined by the studies), or another form of active intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods. Tobacco cessation was measured at the longest time point for each study, on an intention-to-treat basis, using the most rigorous definition available. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for smoking cessation for each study where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison (contingent reinforcement in addition to usual smoking cessation care; more versus less intensive smoking cessation interventions; and multi-issue support versus smoking cessation support only), and carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model. We also extracted data on quit attempts, effects on mental and substance-use severity, and meta-analyzed these outcomes where sufficient data were available. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 10 studies involving 1634 participants who smoked combustible tobacco at enrolment. One of the studies was ongoing. Most of the trials included participants who were recruited from community-based sites such as shelters, and three included participants who were recruited from clinics. We judged three studies to be at high risk of bias in one or more domains. We identified low-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that contingent reinforcement (rewards for successful smoking cessation) plus usual smoking cessation care was not more effective than usual care alone in promoting abstinence (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.77; 1 trial, 70 participants). We identified very low-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias and imprecision, that more intensive behavioral smoking cessation support was more effective than brief intervention in promoting abstinence at six-month follow-up (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.69; 3 trials, 657 participants; I(2) = 0%). There was low-certainty evidence, limited by bias and imprecision, that multi-issue support (cessation support that also encompassed help to deal with other challenges or addictions) was not superior to targeted smoking cessation support in promoting abstinence (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.61; 2 trials, 146 participants; I(2) = 25%). More data on these types of interventions are likely to change our interpretation of these data. Single studies that examined the effects of text-messaging support, e-cigarettes, or cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking cessation provided inconclusive results. Data on secondary outcomes, including mental health and substance use severity, were too sparse to draw any meaningful conclusions on whether there were clinically-relevant differences. We did not identify any studies that explicitly assessed interventions to increase access to tobacco cessation care; we were therefore unable to assess our secondary outcome 'number of participants receiving treatment'. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to assess the effects of any tobacco cessation interventions specifically in people experiencing homelessness. Although there was some evidence to suggest a modest benefit of more intensive behavioral smoking cessation interventions when compared to less intensive interventions, our certainty in this evidence was very low, meaning that further research could either strengthen or weaken this effect. There is insufficient evidence to assess whether the provision of tobacco cessation support and its effects on quit attempts has any effect on the mental health or other substance-use outcomes of people experiencing homelessness. Although there is no reason to believe that standard tobacco cessation treatments work any differently in people experiencing homelessness than in the general population, these findings highlight a need for high-quality studies that address additional ways to engage and support people experiencing homelessness, in the context of the daily challenges they face. These studies should have adequate power and put effort into retaining participants for long-term follow-up of at least six months. Studies should also explore interventions that increase access to cessation services, and address the social and environmental influences of tobacco use among people experiencing homelessness. Finally, studies should explore the impact of tobacco cessation on mental health and substance-use outcomes.","1469-493x     Vijayaraghavan, Maya     Elser, Holly     Frazer, Kate     Lindson, Nicola     Apollonio, Dorie     Journal Article     Meta-Analysis     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     Systematic Review     England     Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020 Dec 3;12(12):CD013413. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD013413.pub2. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1002/14651858.CD013413.pub2,Adult;Bias;Carbon Monoxide/analysis;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy;Cotinine/analysis;Counseling/methods;Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems;*Homeless Persons;Humans;Life Style;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Smoking/blood/*therapy;Smoking Cessation/*methods;Text Messaging;Tobacco Use Cessation Devices,,,N,N,Full text screen

Housing is gendered around physical aspects, as a financial asset, and even in housing data to be a male preserve - excluding females and their perceptions. This important paper addresses this limitation in the literature by examining the views and perceptions of female participants in the Australian Housing Conditions dataset. More specifically this paper examines the significance of household structure, housing quality and characteristics of Australian woman and how it affects their financial strain. As a further dimension this paper also examines differences in women's housing experience by age as older Australian women (above 65 years) have a higher likelihood to revert to substandard housing conditions and homelessness than younger Australian women (under 65 years). Logistic regression analysis shows a higher tendency towards financial strain in women under 65 years, those with either poor physical or mental health and those who were single or lone parents. These finding propose that women under 65 are at greater risk to experience household financial strain and poorer housing security. The paper argues that these results present challenges for Australian housing policy through increasing housing affordability. The analysis suggests that an increase in the availability of affordable housing will ease the financial strain and improve the mental health of Australian women. Moreover, an increase in the flexibility of housing arrangements may prove to be beneficial in providing additional housing solutions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 3 Total Times Cited: 3 Cited Reference Count: 60 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102276,Housing conditions;Gender inequality;Females;Financial strain;Ageing;Housing policy;Australia;HEADED HOUSEHOLDS;HEALTH;WOMEN;CHILDREN;GENDER,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Thus, the present study investigated the links between housing status and HIV testing for PWID. Methods: Respondent-driven sampling recruited 382 HIV-negative PWID, who completed structured interviews in San Francisco. Logistic regression determined whether housing statuses in the past 12 months ([1] owned/rented, [2] single-room occupancy hotels [SROs], [3] living with friends/family/partners, [4] shelters, [5] outdoors) were associated with getting HIV tested in the past 12 months while adjusting for sociodemographics and receptive sharing of injection paraphernalia in the past 12 months. Results: PWID who lived in SROs had greater odds of being tested for HIV than PWID who did not live in SROs (aOR = 1.95, CI.95: 1.06â€“3.60) while adjusting for covariates. Although bivariable analyses indicated that receptively sharing syringes was more common for PWID who lived with others (Ï‡2[3] = 7.94, p = 0.047) or lived outdoors (Ï‡2[3] = 9.50, p = 0.023) than those who did not, respectively, PWID who lived with others (aOR = 1.72, CI.95 = 0.95â€“3.14) or lived outdoors (aOR = 1.37, CI.95 = 0.74â€“2.53) did not show greater odds of HIV testing in multivariable analyses. Conclusions: PWID who lived in SROs had greater odds of HIV testing than PWID who did not live in SROs. Although PWID who lived with others or outdoors showed greater HIV risk, they did not show greater odds of HIV testing. Public health efforts may be reaching PWID in SROs, but more work is needed to reach PWID who live with other people or outdoors.","L2011040008     2021-02-24     2021-07-13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108560,HIV test;adult;article;California;confidence interval;controlled study;cross-sectional study;demography;domestic partner;family;female;friend;harm reduction;homelessness;housing;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;injection drug user;logistic regression analysis;male;multivariate analysis;needle sharing;odds ratio;public health;structured interview;San Francisco,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Vivat, Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London, London, United Kingdom","Background: The mean age of death of homeless people in the UK is 47, and many die with complex unaddressed needs, frequently complicated by substance misuse. However, little research has explored the thoughts or personal experiences of homeless people regarding end of life care (EOLC) or advance care planning (ACP). Methods: As the first stage of a wider study, we conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups with people with past experience of homelessness, exploring their own thoughts and experiences, their perceptions of the experiences of other homeless people, and the implications for care and support of currently homeless people, particularly those with substance misuse issues, who consequently risk death related to liver disease. Results: We interviewed eight people with personal experience of homelessness, all currently working with homeless people in London. Five then took part in a focus group. While recognising the potential value of ACP, most participants, similarly to the general population, did not wish to think about it while the need was perceived as still hypothetical. Instead, they preferred to focus on hope and keeping optimistic that people with liver disease, even when seriously ill, would recover and not die. Their main concern was that professional caregivers, rather than offering ACP to specific individuals, should persevere with providing ongoing compassionate care to all homeless people. They suggested this would enable the development of trust over time, which they saw as a prerequisite for initiating any discussion of EOLC or ACP. Conclusions: Homeless people may be considered more vulnerable and more in need of ACP than the wider population. However, our previously homeless interviewees thought that homeless people primarily need compassionate care and support, not ACP discussions, unless the end of life is extremely pressing. Ongoing caring relationships may build trust and so facilitate broaching EOL issues with homeless people.","L614041825     2017-01-17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1177/0269216316646056,advance care planning;caregiver;death;England;homeless person;homelessness;human;information processing;liver disease;perception;personal experience;population;semi structured interview;thinking;trust;Terminal Care;Advance Care Planning,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Wagner, School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nevada, Reno, 1664 N. Virginia St. MC 0274, Reno, NV, United States","Background: Accidental overdose, driven largely by opioids, is a leading cause of death among people who inject drugs (PWIDs). We conducted secondary analysis of data from a cohort of PWIDs to identify venues where high-risk PWID could be targeted by overdose education/naloxone distribution (OEND) programs. Methods: 573 PWIDs completed a quantitative survey between June, 2012 and January, 2014, which was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. The dependent variable was a dichotomous indicator of experiencing a heroin/opioid-related overdose in the past six months. Independent variables included: demographics, drug use behavior, and encounters with two venues - the health care and criminal justice systems - that could serve as potential venues for OEND programs. Results: Almost half (41.5%) reported ever experiencing a heroin/opioid overdose, and 45 (7.9%) reported experiencing at least one heroin/opioid overdose in the past six months. In the final multivariable model, receiving care in a hospital in the past six months (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AdjOR] 4.08, 95% Confidence Interval [C.I.] 2.07, 8.04, p<. 0.001) and being arrested for drug possession in the past six months (AdjOR 5.17, 95% C.I. 2.37, 11.24, p<. 0.001) were associated with experiencing an opioid overdose in the past six months. Conclusions: Identifying venues outside of those that traditionally target services to PWIDs (i.e., syringe exchange programs) will be critical to implementing OEND interventions at a scale sufficient to address the growing epidemic of heroin/opioid related deaths. Clinical settings, such as hospitals, and drug-related encounters with law enforcement officers are promising venues for the expansion of OEND programs.","L604849040     2015-06-19     2015-08-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.05.026,"buprenorphine plus naloxone;diamorphine;methamphetamine;naloxone;opiate;adult;age distribution;alcohol consumption;article;behavior;cohort analysis;comparative study;controlled study;criminal justice;demography;drug overdose;drug use;drug use behavior;emergency ward;female;health care access;health care delivery;health care planning;health care system;health program;high risk population;homelessness;human;law enforcement;major clinical study;male;medical history;nonfatal opioid overdose;outpatient department;overdose education naloxone distribution program;patient identification;injection drug user;priority journal;suboxone;Analgesics, Opioid",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This article utilises data from a national homelessness services database (PASS system), which captures live information on service user interactions for all state funded NGO and local authority homeless services, to examine the patterns of emergency accommodation use by the homeless population in Dublin City. The paper applies a k-means cluster analysis to determine different subgroups of Dublin's homeless population (n = 12,734) and analyses their rate of movement through homeless services between the years 2012 and 2016. A temporary cluster (78%) experienced a small number of homeless episodes for relatively short periods of time, while an episodic cluster (10%) experienced multiple homeless episodes also for a short period of time. The chronic cluster (12%) experienced a small number of homeless episodes but with long stays in emergency shelter. Results for Ireland show patterns similar to those reported in the US, Canada and Denmark, where a small number of chronic users of homeless accommodation account for a disproportionately large share of resources (i.e. 50% of total bed nights). The findings have implications for the operation of emergency homeless accommodation in Ireland and, in particular, the targeting of interventions and the re-directing of resources away from emergency accommodation responses towards a more effective emergency accommodation system for all stakeholders.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection: 9 Total Times Cited: 9 Cited Reference Count: 42 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: SDOH - Housing Needs | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong topic (emergency shelter use)",10.1016/j.cities.2019.06.008,Homelessness;Cluster analysis;Homeless typology;Emergency accommodation;Ireland;MENTAL-HEALTH;TYPOLOGY;PATTERNS;Emergencies,,,N,N,Full text screen

Walsh, Temple Street Children's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland","Introduction: There is a paucity of knowledge regarding Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) in paediatric patients with Spina Bifida/Myelomeningocoele (SB/MMC). Undiagnosed, untreated SDB has detrimental effects on growth, development (1) and cognition (2) which is especially important to recognise in those with other co-morbidities as is the case in SB/MMC. Aim: There are currently 317 patients aged 0-16 years attending the Spina Bifida service at Temple Street Children's University (TSCUH). Fourteen of 317 patients (4.4%) currently require Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) therapy for SDB under the care of the Respiratory Team. We hypothesize that a subpopulation of the SB/MMC patients are at risk of undiagnosed SDB. We aimed to initially review the demographics of the sub-group of SB/MMC patients currently requiring NIV by assessing for potential predictors of SDB. Method We used up to date medical records of the patients under our care to look for potential predictors for SDB, in particular hydrocephalus with VP shunt, Chiari II malformation and intellectual disability (ID). We then compared our data to what is known about the general SB/MMC population. Results: 100% of SB patients with SDB requiring NIV had hydrocephalus with VP shunt compared to 80% in general SB/MMC patients. 92% also had Chiari II malformation. 50% had a moderate to severe ID in contrast to 25-25% of the general SB/MMC population. Conclusion: A higher proportion of SB/MMC patients known to have SDB have hydrocephalus and ID compared to the SB/MMC population mean. At present there is no standardised screen for SDB in our SB/MMC patients. The results of this review have prompted a clinical audit of all of SB/MMC patients at TSCUH to identify those at higher risk of SDB and ultimately determine the prevalence of SDB in this population.","L628695476     2019-08-01 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong population",10.1136/archdischild-2019-epa.339,adolescent;Arnold Chiari malformation;child;clinical audit;conference abstract;controlled study;diagnosis;female;homeless youth;human;hydrocephalus;intellectual impairment;major clinical study;male;medical record;meningomyelocele;noninvasive ventilation;patient referral;pediatric hospital;prevalence;respiratory system;sleep disordered breathing;Sleep Disorders;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Referral and Consultation;Spinal Dysraphism;Respiration;Sleep,,,N,N,Full text screen

A comprehensive search of relevant databases was undertaken, and studies were included if they were randomized, controlled trials; behavioural intervention related to sexual behaviour; included adults diagnosed with SMI; and if a behavioural outcome was reported. The Cochrane Assessment of Bias Tool was used. Of the initial 515 papers identified, 11 trials were included for quality assessment and data extraction. The studies were heterogeneous in content and dose of intervention, as well as outcome measure and follow-up periods, and all had some risk of bias. Four of the studies demonstrated significant improvement in safer sexual behaviour at follow up, but this effect diminished over time. The effect sizes were extremely variable.

Washio, Treatment Research Institute, Philadelphia, PA, United States","Aims: Large disparities exist in prenatal alcohol use with 24% of Medicaid eligible pregnant women reporting prenatal alcohol use. Prenatal alcohol use puts mothers and their children at risk for pregnancy, birth, and neonatal complications including a leading known cause of brain damage, developmental disabilities, and birth defects in children, known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. In addition, prenatal alcohol use and smoking combined produce the worst birth outcomes. The current study examined demographic variables and other substance use patterns as characteristics of low income pregnant women at risk for prenatal alcohol use. Methods: We conducted brief survey for 140 pregnant women at offices of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). At present, over 95% of women who acknowledged being pregnant have responded to the survey, and 27% have been identified as being at risk for prenatal alcohol use (n = 38) based on scores from the TWEAK. Results: Preliminary findings indicate that lifetime homelessness (p < 0.001), smoking status (p < 0.001), having a history of marijuana use (p = 0.001), and having a history of illicit drug use (p = 0.036) were significantly associated with risk for prenatal alcohol use. When these variables were included in a multivariate model, only lifetime homelessness (p = 0.009) and smoking status (p = 0.002) remained significantly associated with at risk status. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings corroborate earlier studies examining the risk for prenatal alcohol use among economically dis advantaged women and underscore the need for comprehensive services, including housing support and other treatment services, for them.","L71801960     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.728,illicit drug;alcohol consumption;recipient;college;drug dependence;risk;human;female;pregnant woman;child;smoking;lifespan;homelessness;mother;fetal alcohol syndrome;medicaid;congenital malformation;developmental disorder;brain damage;model;infant;lowest income group;substance use;pregnancy outcome;nutrition;cannabis use;pregnancy;drug use;housing;Alcoholics,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

We also examined the relationship between receiving BT and XR-NTX. Methods: Secondary data analysis of SUMMIT, a randomized controlled trial of collaborative care. Participants were 290 individuals with AUDs who reported no past 30-day opioid use and who were receiving primary care at a multi-site Federally Qualified Health Center. Bivariate and multivariate analyses examined predictors of BT and/or XR-NTX. Results: Thirty-two percent (N = 93) received either BT or XR-NTX, 28% (N = 82) received BT and 13% (N = 37) received XR-NTX; 9% (N = 26) received both BT and XR-NTX. Older age, white race, talking with a professional about alcohol use and having more negative consequences all predicted receipt of evidence-based treatment; being homeless was a negative predictor. The predictors of receiving BT included not being homeless and previously talking with a professional; the predictors of receiving XR-NTX included older age, white race and experiencing more negative consequences. In 80% of those who received both BT and XR-NTX, receipt of BT preceded XR-NTX. Conclusions: Patient factors were important predictors of receiving primary-care based AUD treatment and differed by type of treatment received. Receiving BT was associated with subsequent use of XR-NTX and may be associated with a longer duration of XR-NTX treatment. Providers should consider these findings when considering ways to increase primary-care based AUD treatment.","L2001002843     2018-08-07     2018-08-09 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.06.021,naltrexone;opiate;adult;age;alcoholism;article;brief therapy;Caucasian;controlled study;doctor patient relationship;drug dependence treatment;drug formulation;drug release;evidence based medicine;female;health center;health practitioner;homelessness;human;major clinical study;male;prediction;primary medical care;priority journal;randomized controlled trial;Alcoholics,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

PRISMA standards for systematic reviews were used to search five databases as well as grey literature. There were four inclusion criteria; studies had to involve a description of an external (i.e. outside of the home) mental health or psychosocial intervention/treatment, must be focused in LAMIC, must be focused on CASS, and must empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention described. A quality assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias in included articles. Five studies were included. A multidisciplinary care approach was significant in reducing psychological distress, substance use and improving sleeping arrangements (p<0.001, n=400). Residency step programmes were on average 52% successful in reintegrating children back into communities (n=863). Resilience training significantly increased psychological well-being components (p<0.001, n=60). Emotional regulation training had a beneficial improvement in emotional regulation. FORNET (Forensic Offender Rehabilitation Narrative Exposure Therapy) (n=32) reduced the number of self-reported offenses committed [t(19.26)=1.81, p=0.043]. There are not enough credible studies available to develop a firm conclusion on the effectiveness of mental health and psychosocial interventions delivered to CASS in LAMIC.

Recently, attention has focused on the role of these SNPs in determining ADS risk in European populations. To further elucidate these associations, SNPs of interest in ADH1B, ADH1C and the ADH1B/1C intergenic region were genotyped in a British and Irish population (ADS cases n = 1076: controls n = 1027) to assess their relative contribution to ADS risk. A highly significant, protective association was observed between the minor allele of rs1229984 in ADH1B and ADS risk [allelic P = 8.4 Ã— 10âˆ’6, odds ratio (OR) = 0.26, 95 percent confidence interval, 0.14, 0.49]. Significant associations were also observed between ADS risk and the ADH1B/1C intergenic variant, rs1789891 [allelic P = 7.2 Ã— 10âˆ’5, OR = 1.4 (1.2, 1.6)] and three nonâ€synonymous SNPs rs698, rs1693482 and rs283413 in ADH1C. However, these associations were not completely independent; thus, while the ADH1B rs1229984 minor allele association was independent of those of the intergenic variant rs1789891 and the three ADH1C variants, the three ADH1C variants were not individually independent. In conclusion, the rare ADH1B rs1229984 mutation provides significant protection against ADS in this British and Irish population; other variants in the ADH gene cluster also alter ADS risk, although the strong linkage disequilibrium between SNPs at this location precluded clear identification of the variant(s) driving the associations.

In Canada, buprenorphine/naloxone has recently been adopted as the first line agonist therapy given its comparable effectiveness to methadone and superior safety profile. This study examines factors associated with willingness to take buprenorphine/naloxone among opioid users. Methods: Data were derived from two prospective cohorts of high-risk individuals who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with willingness to use buprenorphine/naloxone among people who use opioids and were not currently accessing this treatment option. Participants who were unwilling to use buprenorphine/naloxone were invited to provide reason(s) and their responses were examined in a sub-analysis. Results: Between December 2014 and May 2018, 1103 participants were interviewed. Overall, 194 (17.6%) respondents indicated that they would be willing to take buprenorphine/naloxone. Variables independently associated with willingness were previous buprenorphine/naloxone treatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.04), having ever used methadone treatment (AOR = 1.87), and age (AOR = 0.98, per year older) (all p < 0.05). Satisfaction with current agonist therapy (25.4%), not knowing what buprenorphine/naloxone is (25.1%), and wanting more information about buprenorphine/naloxone (15.1%) were the most commonly cited reasons for unwillingness. A low rate of willingness to use buprenorphine/naloxone (15.1%) was also observed among the sub-set of participants not using methadone. Conclusions: While an overall low level of willingness to take buprenorphine/naloxone was observed, this appeared to be largely driven by satisfaction with other agonists and a low prevalence of community knowledge about buprenorphine/naloxone.","L2003672986     2019-11-12     2019-11-15 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107672,"buprenorphine plus naloxone;diamorphine;methadone;methamphetamine;adult;age;article;attitude to health;Canada;clinical outcome;cohort analysis;drug intoxication;female;follow up;gender identity;homelessness;human;injection drug user;major clinical study;male;opiate addiction;patient satisfaction;prevalence;priority journal;prospective study;questionnaire;Analgesics, Opioid;Buprenorphine",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

This study evaluates whether an addiction consult is associated with 30-day acute care utilization. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 3905 inpatients with SUD. Acute care utilization was defined as any emergency department visit or re-hospitalization within 30 days of discharge. Inverse probability of treatment weighted generalized estimating equations logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between receipt of an addiction consult and 30-day acute care utilization. Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed to describe whether this association differed by type of SUD and discharge on medication for addiction treatment. Results: The 30-day acute care utilization rate was 39.5 % among patients with a consult and 36.0 % among those without. Addiction consults were not significantly associated with care utilization (Adjusted Odds Ratio 1.02; 0.82, 1.28). No significant differences were detected in subgroup analyses; however, the decreased odds among patients with OUD given medication was clinically notable (AOR 0.69; 0.47, 1.02). Discussion: Repeat acute care utilization is common among hospitalized patients with SUD, particularly those seen by the addiction consult services. While this study did not detect a significant association between addiction consults and 30-day acute care utilization, this relationship merits further evaluation using prospective studies, controlling for key confounders and with a focus on the impact of medications for opioid use disorder.","L2006046308     2020-06-05     2020-06-16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108081,barbituric acid derivative;benzodiazepine derivative;buprenorphine;methadone;naloxone;abscess;acute pancreatitis;adult;article;cellulitis;chronic pancreatitis;cohort analysis;consultation;delirium tremens;drug dependence;endocarditis;female;health care utilization;homelessness;hospital emergency service;hospital patient;hospital readmission;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;intoxication;major clinical study;male;mental health service;opiate addiction;osteomyelitis;priority journal;retrospective study;seizure;tenosynovitis;Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome;Referral and Consultation,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Wheeler, The Kirby Institute, UNSW Sydney, Wallace Wurth Building, High Street, Kensington, NSW, Australia","Background: Injecting-related skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are a preventable cause of inpatient hospitalisation among people who inject drugs (PWID). This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hospitalisation for SSTIs among PWID, and identify similarities and differences in factors associated with hospitalisation for SSTIs versus non-bacterial harms related to injecting drug use. Methods: We performed cross-sectional analyses of baseline data from an observational cohort study of PWID attending drug treatment clinics and needle and syringe programs in Australia. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with self-reported hospitalisation for (1) SSTIs (abscess and/or cellulitis), and (2) non-bacterial harms related to injecting drug use (e.g., non-fatal overdose; hereafter referred to as non-bacterial harms), both together and separately. Results: 1851 participants who injected drugs in the previous six months were enrolled (67% male; 85% injected in the past month; 42% receiving opioid agonist treatment [OAT]). In the previous year, 40% (n = 737) had been hospitalised for drug-related causes: 20% (n = 377) and 29% (n = 528) of participants were admitted to hospital for an SSTI and non-bacterial harm, respectively. Participants who were female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.19â€“1.97) or homeless (aOR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.16â€“2.19) were more likely to be hospitalised for an SSTI, but not a non-bacterial harm. Both types of hospitalisation were more likely among people recently released from prison. Conclusions: Hospitalisation for SSTIs is common among PWID. Community-based interventions to prevent SSTIs and subsequent hospitalisation among PWID will require targeting of at-risk groups, including women, people experiencing homelessness, and incarcerated people upon prison release.","L2018989624     2022-07-12     2022-07-26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong country",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109543,needle;syringe;opiate agonist;abscess;adult;article;Australia;bacterial skin disease;cellulitis;cohort analysis;cross-sectional study;drug overdose;female;high risk population;homelessness;hospitalization;human;injection drug user;major clinical study;male;observational study;prevalence;risk assessment;risk factor;self report;soft tissue infection;Prevalence,,,N,N,Full text screen

Specifically, it focusses on the policy context and governance structures that shape the systems of healthcare for homeless people in London, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Design/methodology/approach - Empirically the paper draws on semi-structured interviews with a small sample of policy and practice actors from the devolved territories. Qualitative interviews were supplemented by a comparative policy analysis of the homelessness and health agenda within the devolved regions. Theoretically, it takes inspiration from Chaney's concept of the ""issue salience of homelessness"" and explores the comparative character of healthcare as pertains to homeless people across the devolved territories. Findings - The paper provides clear evidence of areas of divergence and convergence in policy and practice between the devolved regions. These features are shown to be strongly mediated by the interplay of two factors: first, the scope and scale of national and local homelessness prevention strategies; and second, intra-national variation in public health responses to homelessness. Originality/value - The paper offers considerable insight from a comparative policy perspective into the nature of healthcare provision for homeless people in the devolved regions.","Cited By :3     Export Date: 18 November 2022     Correspondence Address: Whiteford, M.; Health Services Research, United Kingdom; email: martin.whiteford@liverpool.ac.uk | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1108/HCS-06-2016-0003,Devolution;Health;Homeless people;Homelessness;Public health;Welfare,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the feasibility of a Collaborative Care intervention for injured patients initiated in the Emergency Department (ED) with self-report PDM and (2) to determine if PDM decreases in the one-month after enrollment. Methods: Injured adults presenting to Harborview Medical Center ED in Seattle, WA from 02/2015 to 09/2015 were screened for eligibility and completed a screening assessment for past 6-month PDM based on NIDA m-ASSIST for prescription opioids, sedatives and stimulants and select questions from the Current Opioid Misuse Measure. Participants with a positive screen completed a baseline assessment and were enrolled in the Collaborative Care intervention and followed for 6-months. Descriptive statistics were calculated and a paired t-test was used to determine the difference between baseline and one-month PDM. Results: A total of 36 participants (56.2% of patients approached, 33% female, 44.3 years old, 31% homeless/temporarily housed) had PDM(36% prescription stimulant misuse, 25% prescription sedative misuse, 97% prescription opioid misuse). All eligible participants that screened positive for PDM (n = 30) agreed to participate and 93% completed the one-month assessment. Baseline levels of polysubstance comorbidity were high; 57% had used heroin, and 83% had used marijuana in the past 6-months and 43% had a prior lifetime overdose. There was no difference in NIDA m-ASSIST scores for prescription stimulants (t =-1.57, p = 0.13), sedatives (t = 0.03, p = 0.98) and opioids (t = 0.46, p = 0.65) from baseline to one month. Conclusions: Initiating a longitudinal Collaborative Care intervention for patients with PDM from the ED is feasible and holds promise as an intervention strategy for this complex population.","L618520307     2017-10-06 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.593,cannabis;central stimulant agent;diamorphine;opiate;prescription drug;sedative agent;adult;clinical article;comorbidity;drug misuse;drug overdose;emergency ward;feasibility study;female;human;male;self report;statistics;Student t test;Feasibility Studies;Drug Prescriptions;Nonprescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Prescription Drugs,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Whittaker, National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Aims: Australian and international evidence highlights the heightened prevalence of substance use disorders in homeless populations. In recent years, adaptions of the Housing First initiative, whereby chronically homeless individuals are provided long-term housing with support, have been implemented across Australia. Two such adaptions include scatter-site (private rental apartments; SS) and congregate site (apartments in the one building; CS) models. There is currently limited Australian evidence on the effect that these variations of Housing First programs have on client outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to undertake a longitudinal evaluation of two adaptations of the Housing First model (one SS and one CS) in relation to clients' housing and health outcomes, specifically substance use patterns and service utilisation. Methods: Longitudinal mixed-methods design comparing process and outcome measures at baseline and 12 months postbaseline. Results: A recruitment rate of 67% was achieved at baseline for both programs, of which 78% were successfully followed-up at 12 months post-baseline. Clients in both models did not differ significantly on demographics, homelessness history or proportion with a substance use disorder. However, at baseline a significantly higher proportion of clients in the CS model had an anxiety disorder (67% vs. 34%) and had recently injected (42% vs. 19%). Findings over time showed that whilst injecting behaviour reduced in the SS model (19-11%), it remained unchanged in the CS model. Whereas deceasing trends were observed for all justice system outcomes in the SS model, overall increases were found for the CS model. Conclusions:Anumber of factors distinguished outcomes in the two Housing First models. Clients entering the CS model appeared to be less well and were injecting drugs more often, suggesting high rates of illicit drug dependence.","L72177021     2016-02-08 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.07.643,illicit drug;housing;college;drug dependence;substance use;model;human;Australian;substance abuse;prevalence;Australia;longitudinal study;criminal justice;population;anxiety disorder;homelessness;health;adaptation,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Wiens, University of Toronto, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto, Canada","Background: Timely access to primary care and adequate disease management are necessary to mitigate severe consequences of diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. People experiencing homelessness face unique challenges to diabetes care including limited access to medical resources and lack of access to healthy foods, which increases their risk of poor outcomes. While the prevalence of diabetes is similar between homeless and non-homeless groups, it is uncertain whether adverse complications are more common among those experiencing homelessness. Aim: The objective of this study was to examine whether a recently documented history of homelessness is associated with higher rates of all-cause mortality among patients with diabetes who use hospital services. Method: We used a propensity-matched cohort study design to compare mortality rates among homeless and non-homeless patients with diabetes, as captured from administrative health care data from Ontario, Canada. Adults with existing diabetes who had at least one hospital admission or emergency department visit between April 1, 2006, and March 31, 2019 were included. Those identified as homeless in their hospital medical charts were followed from the date of their first hospital encounter with a data element indicating homelessness. These elements included no fixed address, being admitted from or discharged to homelessness, or an ICD-10 diagnostic code for homelessness (Z59). Propensity score matching was used to match homeless individuals with a non-homeless individual who shared similar sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. All-cause mortality was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: There were 1,077,000 patients with diabetes who had at least one hospital encounter between April 1, 2006 and March 31, 2018. Of these, 6900 (0.64%) were identified as homeless based on documentation in their hospital records. The average age of the homeless cohort was 56 years old. Most homeless patients were male (67%) and had a diagnosed mental health or addictions issue (75%). A suitable match was found for 5200 homeless patients (total sample = 10,400) with good balance of covariates achieved between groups (SD < 0.1). Compared to non-homeless patients with diabetes, patients with documented homelessness had nearly 1.5 times the hazard of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.36â€“1.55) after matching on potential confounders at baseline. Discussion: The negative impacts of homelessness on health are evident through high rates of chronic disease and complications. The findings of this study demonstrate that among those with diabetes who use hospital services, homelessness is strongly associated with mortality. Future work should strive to understand the causes for excess mortality in this population to inform healthcare strategies to mitigate poor health outcomes among patients with diabetes who experience homelessness.","L2018513256     2022-06-17 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.diabres.2022.109573,addiction;administrative health data;adult;all cause mortality;Canada;chronic disease;clinical feature;cohort analysis;complication;conference abstract;confounding variable;controlled study;demography;diabetes mellitus;diabetic patient;documentation;emergency ward;excess mortality;homeless person;homelessness;hospital admission;hospital service;human;human tissue;ICD-10;Kaplan Meier method;major clinical study;male;medical record;mental health;middle aged;mortality;mortality rate;Ontario;outcome assessment;propensity score,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Black African ethnicity and being born in sub-Saharan Africa are known predictors of HIV co-infection. Methods: We identified adults aged â‰¥15 years diagnosed with TB from 2010-2014 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from national TB surveillance data. HIV status was determined by record linkage to national HIV surveillance data. We calculated the proportion of TB cases diagnosed with HIV and used logistic regression to identify associations between social risk factors (problem drug use, alcohol misuse, imprisonment, homelessness and index of multiple deprivation [IMD] score) and HIV co-infection. Results: 30,064 adults diagnosed with TB were included, 931 (3.1%) were co-infected with HIV. The median age at TB diagnosis was 37 years (inter-quartile range 28-53). Among all TB cases, 4,756 (16.0%) were of black African ethnicity and 14,605 (48.6%) were of Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnicity. 6,754 (22.5%) were UK-born and 3,467 (11.5%) were born in countries with high (>1%) HIV prevalence. Among all TB cases, 780 (2.6%) had a history of problem drug use, 855 (2.8%) alcohol misuse, 723 (2.4%) homelessness, and 772 (2.6%) incarceration. 6,298 TB cases (20.1%) were in the lowest IMD decile. In univariable analyses, increased odds of HIV co-infection were associated with drug use (odds ratio [OR] 2.31, 95% confidence interval 1.73-3.08), homelessness (OR 2.51, 1.88-3.35) and imprisonment (OR 1.55, 1.10-2.18), whilst increasing IMD decile was associated with lower odds of co-infection (OR 0.96 per decile increase, 0.93-0.99). Alcohol misuse was not significantly associated with HIV co-infection. In a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, country of birth and year of diagnosis, drug use remained associated with HIV co-infection (OR 2.44, 1.71-3.49). Conclusion: Problem drug use was associated with a higher prevalence of HIV among TB cases. Greater focus on screening and preventive activities for both TB and HIV may reduce the prevalence of HIV co-infection and improve outcomes for TB patients.

We describe temporal trends in HIV infection amongst patients with TB and identify factors associated with HIV infection. METHODS: We used national surveillance data of all TB cases reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 2000 to 2014 and determined HIV status through record linkage to national HIV surveillance. We used logistic regression to identify associations between HIV and demographic, clinical and social factors. RESULTS: There were 106,829 cases of TB in adults (â‰¥â€‰15Â years) reported from 2000 to 2014. The number and proportion of TB patients infected with HIV decreased from 543/6782 (8.0%) in 2004 to 205/6461 (3.2%) in 2014. The proportion of patients diagnosed with HIV >â€‰91Â days prior to their TB diagnosis increased from 33.5% in 2000 to 60.2% in 2013. HIV infection was highest in people of black African ethnicity from countries with high HIV prevalence (32.3%), patients who misused drugs (8.1%) and patients with miliary or meningeal TB (17.2%). CONCLUSIONS: There has been an overall decrease in TB-HIV co-infection and a decline in the proportion of patients diagnosed simultaneously with both infections. However, high rates of HIV remain in some sub-populations of patients with TB, particularly black Africans born in countries with high HIV prevalence and people with a history of drug misuse. Whilst the current policy of testing all patients diagnosed with TB for HIV infection is important in ensuring appropriate management of TB patients, many of these TB cases would be preventable if HIV could be diagnosed before TB develops. Improving screening for both latent TB and HIV and ensuring early treatment of HIV in these populations could help prevent these TB cases. British HIV Association guidelines on latent TB testing for people with HIV from sub-Saharan Africa remain relevant, and latent TB screening for people with HIV with a history of drug misuse, homelessness or imprisonment should also be considered.","1741-7015     Winter, Joanne R     Stagg, Helen R     Smith, Colette J     Lalor, Maeve K     Davidson, Jennifer A     Brown, Alison E     Brown, James     Zenner, Dominik     Lipman, Marc     Pozniak, Anton     Abubakar, Ibrahim     Delpech, Valerie     SRF-2011-04-001/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom     DRF-2015-08-210/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom     PDF-2014-07-008/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom     SRF-2011-04-001/National Institute for Health Research/International     PDF-2014-07-008/National Institute for Health Research/International     WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom     NF-SI-0616-10037/National Institute for Health Research/International     Journal Article     Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't     England     BMC Med. 2018 Jun 7;16(1):85. doi: 10.1186/s12916-018-1070-2. | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/s12916-018-1070-2,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Anti-Retroviral Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Coinfection/*etiology;England/epidemiology;Female;HIV Infections/*etiology;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Northern Ireland/epidemiology;Prevalence;Retrospective Studies;Tuberculosis/*complications/epidemiology;Wales/epidemiology;Young Adult;Drug misuse;Epidemiology;Hiv;Latent tuberculosis;Trends;Tuberculosis;student Research Ethics Committee (5683/001).

However, limited research has focused on understanding how coping and emotion regulation tendencies might be associated with different patterns of prescription and illicit drug use, particularly among high-risk young adults who may already face additional challenges relative to lower-risk populations. Methods: Young adults aged 16-25 years who had misused prescription drugs within the past 90 days were interviewed in Los Angeles and New York. The current study utilized latent profile analysis to empirically derive coping and emotion regulation typologies/profiles that are then used to predict different patterns of substance use (N = 560). Results: Four latent classes/groups were identified: (1) suppressors, (2) others-reliant copers, (3) self-reliant copers and (4) active copers. Distinct patterns of prescription and illicit drug misuse were found among different coping/emotion regulation profiles, including differences in age of initiation of opiates, tranquilizers, and illicit drugs, recent injection drug use, substance use-related problems, and past 90-day use of tranquilizers, heroin, and cocaine. Specifically, suppressors and others-reliant capers evidenced more problematic patterns of substance use compared to active copers. Conclusion: This is among the first studies to show how coping and emotion regulation profiles predict distinct patterns of substance use. Results provide the groundwork for additional investigations that could have significant prevention and clinical implications for substance-using high-risk young adults.

Wooditch, Criminology, Law and Society, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, United States","Aims: Social and economic supports are often fractured for justice-involved individuals, which impacts involvement in treatment. Little research assesses how housing status and residential transitions relate to substance use and criminal offending among justice-involved individuals. Methods: The sample includes individuals screened for eligibility in a randomized clinical trial on buprenorphine (n = 210). All clients were currently involved in the justice system (probation, parole, or pre-trial release services) and addicted to opioids within the prior 12-months of their assessment. OLS regression models with robust standard error were conducted to explore how the number of changes in housing status, residential mobility (living at home, relatives, or friend's residence), and residing at a halfway house or homeless shelter predict days of illicit substance use, alcohol consumed, and criminal activity. Results: Those who were less residentially mobile (t =-3.63; p < .001) and spent more days stably housed (t = 2.02; p < .05) were considerably more likely to self-report criminal activity. Residing at a halfway house or homeless shelter was associated with a lower likelihood of criminal activity (t =-2.08; p < .05). Participants who resided at halfway house or homeless shelter (t = 1.79; p = .08) had a lower frequency of substance use. Housing factors were unrelated to alcohol use. Conclusions: Participants who were less residentially mobile and more stably housed had a higher likelihood of criminal involvement. These findings were likely due to the participants' stronger social ties to those criminally-involved. Justice-involved individuals residing at a halfway house and homeless shelter was associated with a lower likelihood of illicit substance use and criminal activity, likely due to housing requirements that regulate behavior. Further research in this area needs to explore how social ties moderate the effects of housing stability and mobility on crime and substance use.","L71801983     2015-03-12 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.09.751,"opiate;buprenorphine;alcohol;housing;justice;African American;college;drug dependence;migration;human;offender;substance use;halfway house;clinical trial;friend;model;probation;criminal justice;crime;alcohol consumption;self report;Analgesics, Opioid;African Americans",,,N,N,Title/Abstract

We explore HCV testing uptake amongst people who inject drugs (PWID) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and identify factors associated with i) ever having an HCV test amongst people who have ever injected drugs, and ii) recently having an HCV test (within the current or previous year) amongst people who currently inject drugs (reported injecting drugs within the last year). METHODS: We analysed data from the 2019 'Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring Survey' of PWID, using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 3,127 PWID, 2,065 reported injecting drugs within the last year. Most (86.7%) PWID had a lifetime history of HCV testing. In multivariable analysis, higher odds of ever testing were associated with: female sex (aOR=1.54; 95%CI 1.11-2.14), injecting duration â‰¥3 years (aOR=2.94; 95%CI 2.13-4.05), ever receiving used needles/syringes (aOR=1.74; 95%CI 1.29-2.36), ever being on opioid agonist treatment (aOR=2.91; 95%CI 2.01-4.21), ever being imprisoned (aOR=1.86; 95%CI 1.40-2.48) and ever being homeless (aOR=1.54; 95%CI 1.14-2.07). Amongst PWID who had injected drugs within the last year, 49.9% had recently undertaken an HCV test. After adjustment, factors associated with higher odds of undertaking a recent HCV test included: injecting crack in the last year (aOR=1.29; 95%CI 1.03-1.61), experiencing a non-fatal overdose in the last year (aOR=1.39; 95%CI 1.05-1.85), ever being on opioid agonist treatment (aOR=1.48; 95%CI 0.97-2.25), receiving HCV information in the last year (aOR=1.99; 95%CI 1.49-2.65) and using a healthcare service in the last year (aOR=1.80; 95%CI 1.21-2.67). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that PWID who have experienced homelessness and incarceration - amongst the most vulnerable and marginalised in the PWID population - are engaging with HCV testing, but overall there remain missed testing opportunities. Recent initiates to injecting have highest HCV infection risk but lower odds of testing, and peer-education may help target this group.","1873-4758     Yuan, Jin-Min     Croxford, Sara     Viviani, Laura     Emanuel, Eva     Phipps, Emily     Desai, Monica     Journal Article     Netherlands     Int J Drug Policy. 2022 Nov;109:103821. doi: 10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103821.

Yusuf, Paediatric Neurodisability, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland","Objective: Metabolic investigations are important in the investigation of children with disordered development. The aim of this audit was to determine if paediatric metabolic investigations were ordered as per current best practice evidence at Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin, Republic of Ireland. Methods: We used recommendations from seven publications to guide this audit and identified indications for performing metabolic investigations. We reviewed metabolic investigations sent on paediatric patients at Tallaght University Hospital from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018. We identified the clinical indication for investigating patients by reviewing dictated clinic letters available on the hospital intranet and confirmed investigation results by reviewing scanned copies available on the hospital intranet. We compared the indications for metabolic investigations with published expert guidelines. Results: Metabolic investigations were performed on 254 patients from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2018. Six patients had inconclusive results and were referred to the Metabolic Team at Temple Street Children's University Hospital Dublin for further assessment. There have been no metabolic diagnoses made to date as per Tallaght University Hospital dictated letters. Of the 254 patients, 104 had a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Of those with ASD, 33 had a confirmed or suspected intellectual disability. 158 patients (62%) met best practice recommendations for metabolic investigations. Of the 96 patients who did not fulfil recommendations, 71 (74%) were for children with ASD. Conclusions: We identified two areas that could improve patient care by optimising diagnostic yield and improving resource utilisation at the hospital. First, we recommend clinicians send targeted investigations and avoid blanket investigations for children with disordered development, including ASD. Second, we recommend clinicians include relevant clinical details on request forms to improve diagnostic yield. Finally, we question the value of metabolic investigations for intellectual disability in the absence of other clinical risk factors or comorbidities and suggest this requires further study.","L631605359     2020-05-04 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1111/dmcn.14411,autism;child;comorbidity;conference abstract;controlled study;diagnosis;diagnostic value;female;homeless youth;human;intellectual impairment;intranet;Ireland;major clinical study;male;patient care;pediatric patient;practice guideline;risk factor;university hospital,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Zalla, Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States","Introduction: Despite the higher risk of HIV among female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW), these populations are under-represented in the literature on HIV in Haiti. Here, we present the first nationally representative estimates of HIV prevalence and the first care and treatment cascade for FSWs, MSM and TGW in Haiti. We also examine the social determinants of HIV prevalence in these groups and estimate FSW and MSM population size in Haiti. Methods: Data were collected between April 2016 and February 2017 throughout the 10 geographical departments of Haiti. The Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts (PLACE) method was used to: (1) recruit participants for a behavioural survey; (2) provide rapid testing, counselling and linkage to care for syphilis and HIV; and (3) measure viral load using dried blood spots for participants testing HIV positive. Results: Study participants included 990 FSWs, 520 MSM and 109 TGW. HIV prevalence was estimated at 7.7% (95% CI 6.2%, 9.6%) among FSWs, 2.2% (0.9%, 5.3%) among MSM and 27.6% (5.0%, 73.5%) among TGW. Of participants who tested positive for syphilis, 17% of FSWs, 19% of MSM and 74% of TGW were co-infected with HIV. Economic instability and intimate partner violence (IPV) were significantly associated with HIV among MSM; food insecurity, economic instability and history of rape were significantly associated with HIV among TGW. Fewer than one-third of participants living with HIV knew their status, and more than a quarter of those who knew their status were not on treatment. While approximately four in five FSW and MSM participants on treatment for HIV were virally suppressed, viral suppression was less common among TGW participants at only 46%. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a need for targeted interventions to prevent and treat HIV among key populations in Haiti. Potential high-impact interventions may include venue-based, peer navigator-led outreach and testing for HIV and syphilis and improving screening and case management for structural violence and IPV. TGW are in urgent need of such interventions due to our observations of alarmingly high HIV prevalence and low frequency of HIV viral suppression among TGW.","L2004361751     2020-03-11     2020-03-16 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carolyn""=>""Excluded""}",10.1002/jia2.25281,Abbott RealTime HIV viral load assay;Alere Determine;condom;genetic analyzer;hepatitis C rapid test;HIV test;rapid test;SD Bioline Syphilis 3 0;UniGold;adult;article;disease burden;dried blood spot testing;economic evaluation;female;food insecurity;Haiti;homelessness;human;Human immunodeficiency virus infection;Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence;LGBTQIA+ people;limit of detection;major clinical study;male;male to female transgender;men who have sex with men;coinfection;partner violence;patient care;patient counseling;priority journal;rape;sex worker;syphilis;virus load;OraQuick,,,N,N,Title/Abstract

Methods: Services providing mental health care and support in deprived areas of 14 EU capital cities were assessed with a questionnaire. We analysed the availability and accessibility of those services providing addiction treatment for people from six groups: the long-term unemployed, the homeless, street sex workers, asylum seekers and refugees, irregular migrants and people from travelling communities. Results: While 30% of all the assessed services provided addiction treatment, in 20% of services, addiction was a criterion for exclusion. Among services providing addiction treatment, 77% accepted self-referrals, 63% were open on weekends or in the evening, 60% did not charge any out-of-pocket fees, 35% provided access to interpreters, and 28% ran outreach activities. These results varied substantially among EU capitals. Conclusion: Access to addiction treatment for socially marginalized groups varies across Europe. Some of the models identified may constitute barriers to treatment. Developing care delivery models that facilitate access for vulnerable populations should be a priority for national and European policies.
