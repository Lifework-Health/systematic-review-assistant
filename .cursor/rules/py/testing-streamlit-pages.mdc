# Testing Streamlit Pages with Session State

<CRITICAL_NOTE>
- This rule is outdated. See [streamlit-testing-framework.md](mdc:docs/streamlit-testing-framework.md) for a better way using the Streamlit's native UI testing library that also handles session state for testing.
- These below approaches do work but the native Streamlit testing library offers a better way to handle this in many cases.
- The below guidance is left here for reference as it does contain useful tips and tricks that complement the ST native testing library.
